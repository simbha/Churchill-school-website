      <h1>Summer Fayre 2009</h1>
      <img src="fayre-1.jpg" alt="opening"/>

      <p>On Saturday 11th July 2009 Churchill Primary opened it's doors for our annual Summer Fayre. Although the
      weather was not great, over £2000 was raised.</p>

      <p>This year our Fayre had a village show theme, with traditional categories including ...</p>

      <img src="fayre-2.jpg" alt="vegetable cat"/>

      <p>... animals made from vegetables, ...</p>

      <img src="fayre-3.jpg" alt="owl plate"/>

      <p>... decorated plates, ...</p>

      <img src="fayre-4.jpg" alt="jam"/>

      <p>... jam making ...</p>

      <img src="fayre-5.jpg" alt="cake"/>

      <p>... and the hotly contested "men's victoria sandwich".</p>

      <img src="fayre-6.jpg" alt="box city"/>

      <p>Box City proved a great delight with children and their parents as they used all their building skills to
      create a rabbit warren city.</p>

      <img src="fayre-7.jpg" alt="Mrs Tighe in the stocks"/>

      <p>The highlight of the day was when our head teacher, Mrs Tighe, went into the stocks. Over £100 was raised on
      this stall alone. Mysteriously, no photographic evidence of the event remains. Luckily, our resident artist was on
      the scene!</p>

      <img src="ll0.jpg" alt="table and chairs"/>
      <p>Miss Lewis has always brought a taste of the continent to the school, and in celebration of this she was
      presented with a Café style table and chairs to enjoy her coffee and croissant at in the years to come.</p>

      <img src="ll1.jpg" alt="cake delivery"/>
      <p>After some slightly fraught delivery work...</p>
      
      <img src="ll2.jpg" alt="cake"/>
      <p>... Miss Lewis was presented with a cake, crafted by Mr Marlow.</p>

      <img src="ll3.jpg" alt="year 2 card"/>
      <p>The day before, at their end of year service, Key Stage 1 presented Miss Lewis with a beautiful card consisting
      of a giant dandelion made from painted handprints. Key stage 2 were not to be outdone, presenting Miss Lewis with
      this "Bon Voyage" card.</p>

      <img src="ll4.jpg" alt="inside year 2 card"/>
      <p>Each class created a page for the card, with a personal picture and message from every pupil.</p>
