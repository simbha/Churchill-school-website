      <p>Year 6 spent 16th June surrounded by the magnificent architecture of Wells Cathedral.</p>
      <img src="20100616-124939-0050-JV.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>After a day of workshops, the class gathered, together with many other schools in the area, for a service
      to mark their last term at primary school.</p>
      <img src="20100616-124745-0047-JV.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>A parade of school banners wound its way through the ancient cathedral, finally gathering at the front. Here
      you can just about make out the yellow Churchill bell tower at the back. Longer poles are on order for next year!</p>
      <img src="20100616-125827-0060-JV.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>The vicar was assisted in his sermon about the stepping stones to the future by his friend the mime artist who
      led one of the earlier workshops. The mime artist had wanted to be a rock star, but had discovered that mime
      suited his voice better, thus perfectly illustrating the nature of the stepping stones.</p>
      <img src="20100616-132139-0086-JV.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>After the uplifting service, everyone gathered outside in the glorious sunshine for the trip back to school.</p>
      <img src="20100616-132544-0104-JV.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>Before we let them go, of course, there was the matter of the mandatory group shot in front of the
      Cathedral.</p>
