      <img src="youthspeak.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>We are very proud to announce that on 22nd April we went to the Kings of Wessex School to take part in the
      Youth Speaks District Final 2010. We really enjoyed it. Georgina introduced our speech about why we should eat 5
      fruit and vegetables a day. Jasper wittily spoke to the large audience about the subject. Oliver summed up
      Jasper’s speech and told the audience he had "been converted"! Six acts performed and after a long wait they
      announced the winners. When they called our name (after the runners up) we were so shocked and excited. We really
      couldn’t believe it. Thank you Mrs Penfold and everybody else that supported us.</p>
