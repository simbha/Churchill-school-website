        <h1>Newsletter - 2nd December 2009</h1>

        <p>Yesterday we had a visit from Liz Tunnard (Interim Senior Primary Advisor for North Somerset), who was
        delighted with the school. She was impressed by the children and the work they achieve and for all the hard work
        that staff put in to make Churchill Primary such a special place to be. What a lovely early Christmas
        present!</p>
