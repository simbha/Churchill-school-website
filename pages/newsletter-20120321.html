        <h2>Sport Relief – Friday 23rd March</h2>

        <p>Don’t forget this Friday is mufti day (non school uniform) in aid of sport relief. Please
        make a donation of coins so that we can place them around the playground. The challenge is
        to see how close to a mile we can get by placing the coins we collect around the
        playground!</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Reception</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>Just reminding you that this Friday is the turn of the <span
        class="yeargroup">Reception</span> class to host T@3. Come and enjoy a chat over a
        cuppa!</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> Assembly</h2>

        <p>This Friday <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> will be hosting the assembly and their
        parents are invited to attend. The topic will be the ancient Greeks which they have enjoyed
        learning about this week.</p>

        <h2>Reports</h2>

        <p>These will come home this Friday and in the envelope will be a letter explaining headings
        etc. Each family will also receive a questionnaire to be returned by <strong>Monday 26th
        March</strong> in the box outside the school office. </p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> Trip to St. Fagans</h2>

        <p>Children in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> wrote:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>“This week we went to St. Fagans. We went to the row of cottages that were date from
        1805-1895, it was awesome. We had lunch in a cockpit where cockerels once fought. In the old
        fashioned shop you can get biscuits in brown paper bags. We had a fantastic time!”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Greek Day – <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span></h2>

        <p><strong>Elliot</strong> and <strong>Lexie</strong> wrote:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>“This week <span class="yeargroup">year 5</span> are having lots of fun with their topic,
        the Ancient Greeks. One of the things we have done is Greek day, everyone came dressed up as
        an Ancient Greek, one of the things we enjoyed was the Olympics and Greek food
        tasting. Yesterday we had a fantastic Greek acting workshop with professional actors”.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Tag Rugby Tournament</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> had a fantastic time at the Tag Rugby Tournament
        yesterday. All four teams played really well and should be very proud of their efforts. One
        of the <span class="yeargroup">Year 5/6</span> teams won their first two matches and got
        through to the pitch final. One of the <span class="yeargroup">Year 3/4</span> teams got
        through to the semi-finals. Well done everyone!</p>

        <h2>Reception Visit To Sealife Centre</h2>

        <p>On Tuesday <span class="yeargroup">Reception</span> enjoyed a trip to the Seaquarium in
        Weston. The children each got to hold a mussel and stingray eggs as well as touch a very
        slimy anemone! We also saw some sharks and puffer fish. After lunch we went on the beach for
        a sandcastle competition and some beach races. A good day all day. </p>

        <h2>Round Table – Penguins</h2>

        <p>Thank you to <strong>Mary</strong> and <strong>Ellen</strong> in <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> for their penguin table. The large penguin was called Percy
        and there were 33 penguins in the jar. Well done to the winners <strong>Hannah West</strong>
        (<span class="yeargroup">R</span>) and <strong>Sophie Smith</strong> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y5</span>). </p>

        <h2>National Chip Day</h2>

        <p>Did you know potato chips were invented in 1853 when an angry customer sent his chunky
        chips back to the chef. The chef, also angry, sent back thin potato slices we now enjoy as
        crisps! Thank you to <strong>Ms. Schroeder</strong> and <strong>Mrs. Churchill</strong> our
        ‘calm’ chefs!</p>

        <h2>Spring Forward</h2>

        <p>Don’t forget that the clocks “Spring forward” this weekend. Bearing this in mind we
        though it would be an ideal opportunity to remind everyone that school starts at
        <strong>08:55</strong>. Please let us know if you are going to be late. Thank you. </p>

        <h2>Litter</h2>

        <p>There as been an increase in left litter recently. Please encourage your children to put
        litter in the bins provided and pick up bits that they see dropped even if they are “not
        theirs”.</p>

        <h2>Olympic Update</h2>

        <p>The Olympic torch timetable has now been published and unfortunately the times do not
        fit well with school hours. So instead we will be taking our own Churchill Primary Olympic
        Torch on a tour of our village. Full details to follow.</p>

        <h2>Lunchtimes</h2>

        <p>The <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> girls said they liked the lunchtime assistants
        showing them how to play new games including skipping and oranges and lemons. They also
        enjoyed being able to use the filed this week due to the nice weather.</p>

        <h2>Running</h2>

        <p>Time to get training ready for our sporting event later this year. There are some good
        programmes online or just wander along the Strawberry Line over the Easter holidays.</p>
