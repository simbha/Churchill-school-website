        <h1>Newsletter - 22nd September 2010</h1>


<p>Thank you to everyone who helped to make our 'Peace Day' celebrations memorable: to the 
parents who joined us in service, the children wearing white and to Mrs Williams for teaching us 3 
very special songs.</p>

<h2>Special Children This Week:</h2>

<p>Elliott Shipway who has been playing football for North Somerset U11s and has just been 
selected as the Captain of the team. Here is his report: 'I have been playing with the team 
for a year now. The initial trials were held before the summer, and the final trial is today for 
the new team members to see who is playing in the team with me this year. Last year I 
played in 3 matches and I am really looking forward to the year ahead'.</p>

<h2>Harvest</h2>
<p>This year we have an outstanding number of parents joining us for lunch. The full details 
and arrangements will be on a separate letter. Money raised will be split between Weston 
Hospicecare and Woodford Primary School</p>

<p>*	Woodford Primary will use any money raised to buy seeds which they will plant themselves 
in order to grow food for their lunches.</p>

<p>*	Weston Hospicecare would be very very grateful to receive food donations - every item will 
be used, so fresh or tinned goods can be brought in on 30th September.</p> 

<p>*	Please encourage your children to take part. Thank you in advance on behalf of all those 
who will benefit from your generosity.</p>

<h2>Interesting And True</h2>
<p>Our fact of the week has been chosen by Ben Baker - Did you know that the American 
Government has 7.43 billion grammes of gold tucked away for a rainy day, and it is worth about 
100,000,000,000  dollars or 62.5 billion pounds sterling?</p>

<h2>New Governor</h2>
<p>If you are interested in a position on the Governing Body as Parent Governor please let us know by 
Friday 24th September - see details on the last newsletter or school website.</p>

<h2>Essential Information:</h2>
<p>*	Please remember to update the office if you change any of your contact details</p>

<p>*	We are reviewing our register of children with special medical needs. EVEN IF YOU HAVE 
TOLD US BEFORE (except current Reception Class), please will all parents complete the 
slip at the end of the letter and return to the office by Monday 27 September. Thank you.</p>
