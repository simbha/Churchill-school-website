        <h1>Newsletter - 22nd September 2010</h1>


<p>Thank you to everyone who helped to make our 'Peace Day' celebrations memorable: to the 
parents who joined us in service, the children wearing white and to Mrs Williams for teaching us 3 
very special songs.</p>

<h2>Special Children This Week:</h2>

<h3>Football</h3>
<p><strong>Elliott Shipway</strong> who has been playing football for North Somerset U11s and has just been

the new team members to see who is playing in the team with me this year. Last year I 
played in 3 matches and I am really looking forward to the year ahead'.</p>

be used, so fresh or tinned goods can be brought in on <strong>30th September</strong>.</li>
