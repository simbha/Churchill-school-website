        <h2>PTA Christmas Fayre</h2>

        <p>Congratulations to the new committee on their first Christmas Fayre. We have received
        lots and lots of ‘well done’ messages. We still have an unclaimed hamper so if you think you
        were one of the lucky ones please come to the office. It was a fantastic afternoon, full of
        fun, festive food and fabulous fundraising.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for this week is about the Wise Men.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done to <strong>Alex Cockram</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y1</span>),
        <strong>Ben West</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y5</span>) and <strong>Kylan
        Green</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y6</span>).</p>

        <h2>Christmas Posting</h2>

        <p>The post box for children to send their cards around school is now outside the office. If
        your child is sending cards to their friends please make sure they put the class on the
        envelope as well as the name. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Absences </h2>

        <p>During November there were 6 sessions missed because of holidays. This means children’s
        education is being disrupted and it may impact on the progress they make.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> Christmas Party</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Reception</span> class and <span class="yeargroup">years 1 and
        2</span> will be having a Christmas party on <strong>Thursday, 20th December</strong>. If
        you can you donate ‘a little something’ there is a list of party food outside each
        classroom. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Christingle Service At St. Mary’s </h2>

        <p>On <strong>Tuesday morning</strong> the children will be making their Christingles to
        share and use in our service at <strong>10.45am</strong> at St. Mary’s Church in
        Langford. The Children’s Society introduced this family service in 1968. The orange
        represents the world, the red ribbon indicates the love and blood of Christ, the dried
        fruits and sweets are symbols of God’s creations and the lit candle represents Jesus the
        light of the world. Please come and join us and if you can help walk to the church please
        let your class teacher know. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Carol Service At St. John’s</h2>

        <p>You are all welcome to join us for the St. Johns’s Carol Service on <strong>Wednesday
        19th December</strong> at <strong>6.00pm</strong>. <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span>
        will be leading the service with contributions from <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>
        recorders, the choir and the staff chime bar ensemble.</p>

        <h2>PTA News</h2>

        <p>The PTA would like to thank everyone for their amazing support on Saturday at the
        Christmas Fayre.</p>

        <p>The day went fantastically well thanks to your donations for hampers, stalls and the
        tombola, not to mention delicious cakes and much, much more.</p>

        <p>We would also like to thank the staff who gave up their rooms and their time on Saturday,
        the local residents, the stall holders, Pear Images Photographs, Mary Smallwood for the
        brilliant decorations and of course Santa for finding the time to fit us in.</p>

        <p>We couldn’t have done it without all the parents who gave up their time to help set up,
        clear away and run a stall, so thank you, and thanks to everyone who enjoyed the afternoon
        and spent lots of money. The profits from the day look amazing and we will let you know the
        final figure in due course.</p>

        <p>Thank you from the PTA</p>
