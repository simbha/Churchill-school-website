        <h2>Sports Day</h2>

        <p>Our School Sports Day is this Friday. Please arrive at school at about <strong>13:10</strong> for a
        <strong>13:15</strong> start. Chairs will be set out on the right hand side of the field for you. We are still
        in need of volunteer helpers, so if you can let Miss Higgins in Reception Class know if you are available we
        would be most grateful or come to school at <strong>13:00</strong>!</p>

        done to you all!</p>

        <h2>Dinner Money</h2>

        <p>Dinner money remains at <strong>£1.95</strong> per day (<strong>£9.75</strong> per week).  If you would like
        to pay until the end of the Summer Term the amount would be <strong>£60.45</strong> (please make cheques payable
        to “North Somerset Council").  Please remember that dinner money needs to be paid at the beginning of the
        week that your child requires a meal or during the first week of the term if you pay half-termly.</p>

        <h2>How is your £ Growing?</h2>

        <p>Just a reminder that the Grow your £ money needs to be returned to school by Wednesday 23 June. So far we
        have had reports of children selling plants outside their house, selling ice pops, watering plants and making
        cakes! Can you think of anything else? If you have not been able to complete an activity, please return your £1
        coin. There will be an assembly on the afternoon of 23 June; if the children have any photos of them carrying
        out their activity it would be lovely to see them.  - Many thanks from the PTA</p>

        <h2>Swimming Gala</h2>

        <p>Could anyone help with the Swimming Gala on Tuesday 22nd June?  We are in need of two volunteers.  Please see
        Miss Higgins in Class R if you are able to help.</p>

        <h2>Sports Day Tea @ Three</h2>

        <p>After our School Sports Day, we will be holding our Tea at Three, hosted by Class 3.  Please stay for a
        relaxing chat and some tea or coffee and maybe a cake or two!</p>

        <h2>Music Tuition</h2>

        <p>If you would like to order/continue Music Tuition for your children for the Autumn Term, please return the
        pink letters sent home on 24th May by tomorrow (17th June) at the latest.  Thank you.</p>
