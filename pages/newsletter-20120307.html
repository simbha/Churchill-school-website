        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> Steam Trip</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> went to the Steam Museum in Swindon on Tuesday.
        <strong>Daniel</strong> and <strong>Benedict</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“We extremely enjoyed the trip because we learnt how an evacuee in
        WW2 would feel in their every day life and their emotions. Our favourite part was when the
        siren went off and we had to walk into the air-raid shelter. It was an amazing
        experience”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Music Festival</h2>

        <p><strong>Charles</strong> and <strong>Ellen-mai</strong> from <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“A BIG thank you to <strong>Mrs Barrett</strong> and <strong>Miss
        Mullins</strong> for letting us go and take part in the music festival, we really enjoyed
        singing and hearing all about the aliens travelling to Proxima. We learnt a lot about
        Proxima from this and the narration. Thank you also for all the mums and dads that come to
        watch us”.</p></blockquote>
