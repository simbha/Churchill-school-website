        car please consider parking in the Stag and Hounds car park and walking through the lane to
        school. ‘Footprint’ stickers will be given to those children who walk/scoot to school. Lets
        see if we can beat last years numbers of walkers.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS 1</span> End of term service</h2>

        <p>On <strong>Tuesday 7th February</strong> we will be having an end of term service at
        St. Mary’s Church. If any parents would like to join us we will be leaving school at
        <strong>09:15</strong>. Why not join us afterwards for a warming coffee?</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS 2</span> Science Club</h2>

        forms need to be in by this <strong>Friday, 3rd February</strong>. We will send a list out

        <h2>Governors profile - Lorna Vickery, Parent Governor &amp; Vice Chair</h2>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I have three children – two of them are at the Primary School and the third is at
        Pre-School. I wanted to become a governor as I was interested in how children are taught in
        primary school, and how they are prepared for the big changes in their lives as they grow
        up, move to senior school and into work. I also wanted to contribute to the life of the
        school and felt this would be a good way for me to do so. I have been a governor since
        September 2009.</p>

        <p>I am a member of the curriculum committee which allows me to develop my interest in how
        policies that are introduced by the government of the day are implemented and affect our
        children in school. As a governor my special subject area of responsibility is science. </p>

        <p>I read Economics at Liverpool University before joining Tesco, initially in their
        property department where I was lucky enough to spend some time living in central
        Europe. When I returned I joined the marketing department, where I was marketing manager for
        the Clubcard scheme. I gave up work when I started a family.</p>

        <h2>Australia Day</h2>

        <p>We decorated our Round Table with all things Australian and learnt about the traditions
        and animals of the country. Many children also had a go on a didgeridoo, making some very
        interesting sounds and entertaining the office staff!</p>

        <h2>Chocolate Cake Day</h2>

        <p>Wow! What a treat we shared on Chocolate Cake Day! Each child tasted a chocolate sponge
        cake and a chocolate crispy cake. There were lots of interesting descriptions such as gooey,
        crunchy and yummy! Each class voted for their favourite with the sponge cake winning by a
        big margin in most classes. Our thanks go to <strong>Miss Schroeder</strong> who surpassed
        herself with the lovely cakes and always works so hard to provide the children with these
        experiences. </p>

        <h2>Knitting with Granny</h2>

        <p><strong>Connie Rawlins</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> has been very
        busy knitting a blanket of squares with her grandmother which you can see on the pew in the
        main entrance foyer. Next week we will be sending it to South Africa.</p>
