	<h2>Lastly</h2>

	<p>Eleven thousand people ran the Bristol Half Marathon on Sunday, amongst them two school governors
	(the third sadly had a back injury so was unable to take part) and myself. We were running in support
	of St. Peter’s Hospice. Many lives in our school and the wider community have been touched by cancer
	and it was an opportunity to remember them all.</p>

	<p>We are always encouraging children to work hard and do their best – so it was lovely to share this
	achievement with pupils in worship on Monday still wearing my running shoes welded to my feet! (High
	heels to return next week). If you would like to make a donation or sponsorship for the hospice please
	send it to the office. Thank you in advance.</p>
