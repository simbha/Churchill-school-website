        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        
        <p>We are a C.E.V.C primary school, catering for children between the ages of 4 and 11. We are located in the
        West Country, in beautiful countryside at the foot of the Mendip Hills, and are maintained by North Somerset
        Council. Our head teacher's name is Mrs Tighe.</p>

        <p>There are approximately 200 pupils on roll, most living within the community. The majority of pupils are
        expected to continue their education at <a href="http://www.churchill.n-somerset.sch.uk/">Churchill Community
        School</a> (comprehensive).</p>

        <p>Please stay a while and explore our site, many of our pupils have worked very hard to contribute to it and
        would be delighted to receive any feedback</p>
