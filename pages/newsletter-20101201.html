	<h2>Feel you could help?</h2>

	<p>The Community School have joined forces with us in encouraging children to knit blankets
	to send to Woodford Primary School in South Africa. If you have any remnants of wool you
	would like to donate please pop them into the office. If you would like to help our children
	knit or would like to form a parents “knitting” group please come and let us know.</p>

	<h2>Photos Make Great Christmas Presents</h2>

	<p>Steve and Barbara of “Pear Images” will be running a professional photography studio for
	family portraits at the school Christmas Fair this Saturday. Prices start from £5.</p>
