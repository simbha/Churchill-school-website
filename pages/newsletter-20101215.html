	<h1>Newsletter - 15th December 2010</h1>

	<p>Happy Christmas to our school community. We hope you enjoy the holidays with the children
	and look forward to seeing everyone back on <strong>Tuesday 4th January 2011</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Carol service tonight</h2>

	<p>Tonight, <strong>Wednesday 15th December</strong>, is our traditional Carol service at
	St. John’s Church (next to the Community School). The children have been learning the words
	to Carols and the orchestra, choir and Year 3 recorder group have been practicing hard. We
	hope you will join us. Church doors open at <strong>18:15</strong> – dress warmly!</p>

	<p>If you can’t join us tonight why not come and sing “around the Christmas tree” on
	<strong>Friday 17th December</strong>. The PTA will be giving everyone a “treat” – mulled
	wine and mince pies. Please join them in the library at <strong>14:15</strong> and then come
	and sing your heart out.</p>

	<h2>Christmas lunch</h2>

	<p>The Christmas lunch was a huge success. Over 300 people shared a beautifully cooked
	meal. Thank you to everyone who was involved, especially <strong>Mrs. Beadle</strong>,
	<strong>Ms. Schroeder</strong> and <strong>Mrs. Brocksom</strong>.</p>

	<p>The Christmas pudding we made on “Stir Up Monday” was delicious. Well done children!</p>

	<h2>Win a bike for Christmas </h2>

	<p>Bike raffle tickets will be on sale each day before school. If you aren’t in school you
	could send £1 per ticket in an envelope to your child’s class teacher.</p>
