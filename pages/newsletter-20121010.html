        <h1>Newsletter - 10th October 2012</h1>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week is about belonging.</p>

        <h2>R.E.</h2>

        <p>Exciting things have been happening to our RE curriculum at school. Whilst all the
        children were enjoying the first day of their summer holidays, the teachers were joined by
        <strong>Dave Francis</strong> (who leads the subject for the whole of North Somerset) on
        their in-service day. He demonstrated the new website that has been created for teachers to
        use and explained how the new units are more investigational and start from posing
        interesting questions. Meanwhile <strong>Mrs Tighe</strong> has very kindly purchased some
        beautifully carved wooden crosses. They are all uniquely hand made and each class has their
        own to use for reflection and contemplation. Recently <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage
        2</span> have been busy writing their own prayers to recite at the end of the day on a rota
        basis (so have <span class="yeargroup">Class 2</span>!) and the rest of <span
        class="yeargroup">Key Stage 1</span> have been learning one altogether. A candle (battery
        operated so safe!)  is lit just before home time and a prayer read out, a lovely way to end
        the school day! Here at Churchill we have also been very active in partaking in RE
        competitions, our old <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> took part in an art competition
        run by NATRE entitled Art in Heaven and although we did not win their entries were stunning!
        The current <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> is just about to enter a local competition
        where they have to design a PowerPoint presentation describing their ideal church. We wish
        them all the best! </p>

        <h2>Jeans For Genes Day</h2>

        <p>Walking into school this Monday you may have noticed something a little unusual.  Many of
        us swapped our normal trousers and skirts for something a little more casual – jeans!
        Children and staff donned jeans in order to support ‘Jeans for Genes’ Day.  This annual
        event, organised by Genetic Disorders UK, raises money to help support, care and change the
        lives of children with genetic disorders.  With your support we raised <strong>£90</strong>,
        thank you!</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> Cluster Schools Football</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> had a wonderful time on their trip to Knapp House
        last week. <strong>Sophie</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“There were lots of exciting activities that I had never tried
        before”</p></blockquote>

        <p>and <strong>Matthew</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“We had lots of fun and learnt new things at the same time.”</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Walk To School Day</h2>

        <p>Well done <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>! 21 children walked/scooted to school,
        while other classes lagged behind:</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Reception</th><td>58%</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 1</th><td>76%</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 2</th><td>73%</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 3</th><td>81%</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 4</th><td>59%</td></tr>

        <h2>In The Mornings…</h2>

        <p>As we continue to promote independent and initiative, we strongly encourage you to let
        your children head into school on their own once the morning bell has gone.  Furthermore, if
        you’d like to talk to your child’s class teacher, please try to catch them before the
        <strong>8.55am</strong> bell.  After this time they will busy settling the children into
        their school day.  Alternatively, you can always catch them at the end of the school day
        once your child has been dismissed.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> Reading Diaries</h2>

        <p>Please could we ask parents to sign their children’s reading diaries to show their class
        teacher that the books are being shared with them. Thank you.</p>
