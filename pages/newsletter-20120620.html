        <h1>Newsletter - 21st June 2012</h1>

        <h2>Jubilee Fair</h2>

        <p>A thank you from the committee —</p>

        <p>We are delighted to announce that the Jubilee event raised about
        <strong>£2,000</strong>. This is in addition to the monies raised by individual stalls
        e.g. Rainbows and St Johns Church.</p>

        <p>Some of the money raised will be put towards items that can be used by the whole village
        community in the future. Ideas already put forward include a marquee and new speakers
        suitable for outside use. Update to follow.</p>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>Next week the theme for our assemblies will be buildings.</p>

        <p>This <strong>Friday</strong> the assembly will be taken by <span
        class="yeargroup">Reception</span>. Parents are most welcome to join us at
        <strong>9.00am</strong> in the school hall.</p>

        <h2>School Gates</h2>

        <p>The school gates are unlocked at <strong>8.40am</strong> each day. Please could you avoid
        using the front entrance.</p>

        <h2>Considerate Parking</h2>

        <p>Please could you make sure that, when parking by the school, you avoid parking on grass
        verges, double yellow lines and are considerate to our neighbours.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>This will be held on <strong>Wednesday 20th June</strong> before our sports day, but if this is cancelled
        T@3 will be held at the usual time on <strong>Friday 22nd June</strong>. </p>

        <div id="pink">
        <h2>Pink Day – Friday 22th June</h2>

        <p>A day to remember those who battle cancer. Children are invited to wear “something” pink
        instead of uniform. No donation is requested. This is just a reminder to encourage us to
        think of other people.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>French Day</h2>

        <p>On <strong>Wednesday, 27th June</strong> we will be having a French Day in
        school. Children are invited to come to school dressed in bleu, blanc et rouge (blue, white
        and red). There will be a special French menu for those having a school dinner, traditional
        stories told by a French story teller for <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> and <span
        class="yeargroup">KS2</span> and other surprises.</p>

        <h2>National Eat Your Vegetables </h2>

        <p>We hope your children are enjoying their vegetable tasting. Children are fascinated by
        plants growing so if you have a small pot of soil why not plant a bean or potato and let
        them see what you can grow in quite a short time.</p>

        <p>We have vegetable seeds in school. If you would like some please get your child to ask at
        the office.</p>

        <h2>Handwriting</h2>

        <p>Congratulations to the following children whose handwriting was judged as excellent by
        our team of judges:</p>

        <h2>Explorer Dome Visit </h2>

        <p>Wow! What a fantastic day. Our Wonderful World theme was a great success. Each year group
        was allocated a specific time to enter by crawling into the dome. Look out for our cross
        curricular posters which will be on display towards the end of term. A huge thank you to the
        P.T.A for funding this event.</p>


        <h2>School Improvement Plan</h2>

        <p>Governors are meeting to think about areas for development for next year at
        <strong>7.30pm</strong> on <strong>20th June</strong> in the library if you would like to
        join us.</p>

        <p>We will be using your comments from the questionnaire you completed in April, but if you
        have any other ideas please drop us a note or pop in to the office.</p>

        <h2>Dinner Money &amp; Menus</h2>

        <p>Dinner money until the end of term is <strong>£56.00</strong>. New menus are available
        from the office.</p>

        <h2>A Child’s View Of Lunchtime</h2>

        <p><strong>Sophia</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> likes the fact that the
        playground has lots of shady areas and that on Mondays and Fridays you can go to the
        library.</p>
