	<h1>Newsletter - 8th June 2011</h1>

	<p>Welcome back to the "summer" term. We are all looking forward to enjoying our lovely
	outside areas. Over the holidays we have had some new storage areas installed for outside
	play equipment. This will enable our lunchtime assistants to offer a wider variety of
	activities to the children. We are eagerly awaiting the construction of a small amphitheatre
	and traversing wall (with slide to be purchased by PTA). Details to follow.</p>

	<h2 id="quiz">Quiz Night</h2>

	<p>Don't forget this <strong>Saturday</strong> is the PTA Quiz Night starting at
	19:30. Teams will Consist of 6 people (or thereabouts) and costs <strong>£5</strong> per
	person to include supper.  Why not get a class team together and challenge last times
	winners? </p>

	<h2 id="walk">Walk To School Week</h2>

	<p><strong>Monday, 13th to Friday, 17th June</strong> is Walk to School Week. Please
	encourage your child to walk, cycle, skate or scoot to school. We will try to beat our
	previously best record of 92%. To further encourage our healthy start to each day a
	different year group will be time tabled to play on their bikes, scooters at lunchtime
	(weather permitting). If you have a bike a helmet will be required. <span
	class="yeargroup">Reception</span> class and <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> will be
	on the <strong>Monday</strong>, <span class="yeargroup">Years 2 and 3</span> will be on
	<strong>Tuesday</strong>, <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> on
	<strong>Wednesday</strong>, <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> <strong>Thursday</strong>
	and <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> <strong>Friday</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Assembly Theme</h2>

	<p>The theme for the next week is the meaning of Pentecost.</p>

	<h2>Fact Of The Week</h2>

	<p><strong>Lucy</strong> and <strong>Sophie</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year
	4</span> have found out that the moon weighs 81 billion billion tons!</p>

	<h2>Scooters</h2>

	<p>If your child brings a scooter to school please remind them it should be "parked" in the
	cycle bay by the back gate until the end of the school day (except when it is their class's
	lunchtime scooter day). For everyone's safety we ask that children do not ride scooters in
	the playground before and after school. Thank you.</p>

	<h2 id="international">International Week Beginning 13th June</h2>

	<p>Children will be learning about differences and similarities of childhood around the
	world and enjoying drumming, food, puppets, arts and crafts, map work and many other
	activities.</p>

	<h2>Summer Fair</h2>

	<p>If you would like to place an advertisement in our PTA school booklet, which will go out
	to over 500 houses in early July, please come to the school office for more information.
	There are plans to include an "Art and Craft Show" section, so get planting now. Remember,
	if you have any old or unwanted crockery please bring it to the school office.  Thank
	you. </p>

	<h2>School Choir</h2>

	<p><strong>Louise Maitland-Round</strong> has informed us that the school choir would like
	more people to attend. This after school club is on a <strong>Monday</strong> and runs until
	<strong>16:15</strong>. Louise really enjoys the choir and they will be performing at the
	Summer Fair. Contact <strong>Miss Mullins</strong> for more details.</p>

	<h2>Dinner Money</h2>

	<p>Is still <strong>£1.97</strong> per day, the total until the end of term is
	<strong>£64.35</strong>.</p>

	<h2>School Council</h2>

	<p>The school council have been involved in making the library into a more inviting and cosy
	place and have ordered some bean bags and a rug. We are hoping to open the library in the
	evenings very soon.</p>

	<h2>Cartoons</h2>

	<p><strong>Sophie-Marie</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> would like pupils
	to draw a pencil drawing of a cartoon of their choice. It is not a competition and is just
	something nice she would like them to do. If Sophie-Marie receives over 100 cartoons the
	whole school will be allowed some golden time.</p>

	<h2>Norman The Bearded Dragon</h2>

	<p>Norman's previous "house" is up for sale. It is very similar to his current home but a
	little smaller being 18" tall x 36" long and 24" deep. It is suitable for reptiles such as
	snakes, bearded dragons and much more. It is in good condition and is a snip at
	<strong>£24.99</strong>!</p>

	<h2>Mobile Phone Collection</h2>

	<p>The four ex Primary School pupils who are raising funds to go on a community project in
	South Africa are still collecting mobiles phones. If you have any lying around gathering
	dust then please can they have them?  They are also offering a dog walking service. So if
	you have a dog that would appreciate a walk please contact <strong>Mrs. Folkes</strong> in
	the school office for more information.</p>
