        <h1>Newsletter - 8th June 2011</h1>

<p>Welcome back to the "summer" term. We are all looking forward to enjoying our lovely outside areas. Over the holidays we have had some new storage areas installed for outside play equipment. This will enable our lunchtime assistants to offer a wider variety of activities to the children. We are eagerly awaiting the construction of a small amphitheatre and traversing wall (with slide to be purchased by PTA). Details to follow.</p>

<h2>Quiz Night</h2>
<p>Don't forget this Saturday is the PTA Quiz Night starting at 7.30pm. Teams will 
Consist of 6 people (or thereabouts) and costs £5 per person to include supper. 
Why not get a class team together and challenge last times winners? </p>

<h2>Walk To School Week</h2>
<p>Monday, 13th to Friday, 17th June is Walk to School Week. Please encourage your child to walk, cycle, skate or scoot to school. We will try to beat our previously best record of 92%. To further encourage our healthy start to each day a different year group will be time tabled to play on their bikes, scooters at lunchtime (weather permitting). If you have a bike a helmet will be required. Reception class and Year 1 will be on the Monday, Years 2 and 3 will be on Tuesday, Year 4 on Wednesday, Year 5 Thursday and Year 6 Friday.</p>

<h2>Assembly Theme</h2>
<p>The theme for the next week is the meaning of Pentecost.</p>

<h2>Fact Of The Week</h2>
Lucy and Sophie in Year 4 have found out that the moon weighs 81 billion billion tons!

<h2>Scooters</h2>
<p>If your child brings a scooter to school please remind them it should be "parked" in the cycle bay by the back gate until the end of the school day (except when it is their class's lunchtime scooter day). For everyone's safety we ask that children do not ride scooters in the playground before and after school. Thank you.</p>

<h2>International Week Week Beginning 13th June</h2>
<p>Children will be learning about differences and similarities of childhood around the world and enjoying drumming, food, puppets, arts and crafts, map work and many other activities.</p>

<h2>Summer Fair</h2>
<p>If you would like to place an advertisement in our PTA school booklet, which will go out to over 500 houses in early July, please come to the school office for more information.  There are plans to include an "Art and Craft Show" section, so get planting now. Remember, if you have any old or unwanted crockery please bring it to the school office.  Thank you. </p>

<h2>School Choir</h2>
<p>Louise Maitland-Round has informed us that the school choir would like more people to attend. This after school club is on a Monday and runs until 4.15. Louise really enjoys the choir and they will be performing at the Summer Fair. Contact Miss Mullins for more details.</p>

<h2>Dinner Money</h2>
<p>Is still £1.97 per day, the total until the end of term is £64.35.</p>

<h2>School Council</h2>
<p>The school council have been involved in making the library into a more inviting and cosy place and have ordered some bean bags and a rug. We are hoping to open the library in the evenings very soon.</p>

<h2>Cartoons</h2>
<p>Sophie-Marie in Year 4 would like pupils to draw a pencil drawing of a cartoon of their choice. It is not a competition and is just something nice she would like them to do. If Sophie-Marie receives over 100 cartoons the whole school will be allowed some golden time.</p>

<h2>Norman The Bearded Dragon</h2>
<p>Norman's previous "house" is up for sale. It is very similar to his current home but a little smaller being 18" tall x 36" long and 24" deep. It is suitable for reptiles such as snakes, bearded dragons and much more. It is in good condition and is a snip at £24.99!</p>

<h2>Mobile Phone Collection</h2>
<p>The four ex Primary School pupils who are raising funds to go on a community project in South Africa are still collecting mobiles phones. If you have any lying around gathering dust then please can they have them? 
They are also offering a dog walking service. So if you have a dog that would appreciate a walk please contact Mrs. Folkes in the school office for more information.</p>

<h2>Vulnerable/sen Students</h2>
<p>Churchill Community School are holding a meeing for parents of vulnerable/SEN students on Wednesday, 22nd June at 6.00pm in the Stuart House Well. For more information contact Pauline Trapp on 852771.</p>

<h2>Lost?</h2>
<p>We have had a patterned front door type key handed into the office. If you think you have lost one please call in.</p>
