<h2>National Doughnut Day By Emily In Year 3</h2>
<p>National doughnut day is held on the first Friday of June each year and was created by the Salvation Army in 
1938 where they served doughnuts to soldiers during the First World War. In 1917 the Salvation Army sent 
about 250 of their volunteers on a fact finding mission to France. Margaret Sheldon had one very busy day 
where she made 22 pies, 300 doughnuts and 700 cups of coffee. </p>
