        <h1>Newsletter - 11th November 2009</h1>

        <p>We held our Remembrance Service this morning where children were reminded of the sacrifice others have made
        so that we can all live the free existence that we do today.  Thank you to all those who sent in donations to
        the Poppy Appeal, they were much appreciated.  Thank you also to William Maitland-Round who did such a good job
        circulating the Poppies to the classes.</p>
