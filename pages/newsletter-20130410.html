        <h1>Newsletter - 10th April 2013</h1>

        <p>I hope everyone enjoyed the Easter break. We are all looking forward to an exciting
        <strong>Term 5</strong>, with plans for several special days in school during the term. It
        may be helpful to know:-</p>

        <div id="days">
        <ul>
          <li>St. Georges Day – <strong>23rd April</strong> We celebrate this day to remember that
          when faced with difficulties we should continue to be bold like St. George, patron saint
          of England. Come to school in Brownie/Scout uniform or wear something red, white or blue
          instead of school uniform.</li>

          <li>No Sox day – <strong>8th May</strong> We mark this day to remind ourselves of children
          in Africa who walk to school daily, through all weathers, all year, with no socks. Come in
          school uniform but without socks. If you wish to make a donation please give to your class
          teacher. All proceeds will be sent to Woodford Primary School, the school we are linked
          with in South Africa, to buy socks for their children.</li>

          <li>For more information on forthcoming events see dates at end of this letter.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>This week we are celebrating the wonders of Spring and considering the need to take care
        of our environment. Next week’s theme will be around friendship and treating each other with
        respect in our daily lives.</p>

        <h2>Easter Walk</h2>

        <p>Thank you to everyone who walked with us as we visited the five ‘stations’ of the Easter
        Story. The children were a credit to all of you; their manners, co-operation and behaviour
        were impeccable. <strong>Hattie</strong> and <strong>Connie</strong> in <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“We walked to the church to celebrate the last supper
        where we had bread and squash. We walked to the green and stood quietly and thought about
        the Garden of Gethsemane. We then went back to school and sang an Easter song and shared
        chocolate biscuits”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Tag Rugby Tournament</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 3 to 6</span> attended a tag rugby competition in Hutton
        Moor on the last Thursday of term. The children all played extremely well despite the
        weather conditions and won lots of their matches. Well done to all.</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>

        <p>Well done <strong>Tom Risk</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y6</span>) and
        <strong>Oliver Walford</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">R</span>) who received football
        certificates last term for their great team spirit and skills</p>

        <h2>Ofsted</h2>

        <p>We are still awaiting our HMI visit. In the meantime we have been working to improve the
        teaching of maths across the school and were pleased with the positive comments on our
        progress, after our North Somerset Maths Review Day. The review was led by <strong>Sue
        Ivermee</strong>, Head Primary Advisor, and two advisers from North Somerset Council. They
        spent the day in school observing the teaching, talking to children, looking at pupils books
        and the progress they had made. Thank you to the Governors who joined the team and took part
        in the interviews, also the staff for all their hard work in improving maths teaching across
        the school .</p>

        <h2>Teacher Led Clubs</h2>

        <p>The following clubs chess, Zumba, netball, choir and creative writing will start next
        week (<strong>15th</strong>) with the same children as last term. Running club will begin
        the following week (<strong>16th</strong>), with the same children as last
        term. Mrs. Tighe’s kitchen club will also begin on <strong>16th</strong> and has 12 places
        available to NEW children. Please call into the office for a letter. Mrs. Strawbridge will
        be running a country dancing club for <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> only on
        Tuesdays. All clubs are open to existing members and anyone else wishing to start please
        come to the office for details.</p>

        <p>Orchestra club will NOT be running this term but we hope to restart this in September if
        there is sufficient interest. Please let <strong>Miss Mullins</strong> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y3</span>) know if you would like to be part of next years orchestra.</p>

        <h2>Statatory Inspection Of Anglican Schools (SIAS)</h2>

        <p>Our report has now been received and a copy of it will be sent to you by the end of the
        week.</p>

        <h2>Dinner Money</h2>

        <p>If you would like your child to enjoy our new school dinner menu this term, we would ask
        you to send <strong>£70</strong> into school in a clearly marked envelope. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Questionnaire Feedback</h2>

        <p>We have grouped the comments on the questionnaires together as far as possible and each
        week will seek to address the points you have raised in the two categories ‘what you like’
        and ‘what we could do better’.</p>

        <h2>What You Would Like Us To Do Better – Special Days</h2>

        <p>We celebrate special days to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Raise children’s awareness of the wider world</li>

          <li>Add fun to the curriculum and inspire children’s curiosity</li>

          <li>Support charities</li>

          <li>Increase children’s knowledge and understanding of the world</li>

          <li>Enjoyment for all</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our special days are linked to Worship themes so we explain to children our reasons for
        celebrations. We will strive to make this clearer to all children.</p>

        <p>Comments ranged from too many/too few/not enough notice/too expensive.</p>

        <p>At the start of each school year we send out a list of dates for the year and we
        endeavour not to change these, occasionally we do add extras! The weekly school letter then
        gives fuller details of events coming up over the next month. We will now add more detail to
        the letters so guidelines are clearer.</p>

        <h2>What You Like – Positive Attitudes of Staff</h2>

        <p>Comments included approachable/friendly/fun and kind/KS1 induction really
        good/encouraging/fantastic teachers/easy to talk to about concerns/warm and friendly
        staff/open door policy/staff listen.  Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Maths Books</h2>

        <p>If you would like to help or encourage your children in maths we have a number of books
        available in the office (or for ordering) including ‘Maths for Mums and Dads’ - £4, ‘More
        Maths for Mums and Dads – The Teenage Years’ - £4.00 and ‘Usborne First Illustrated Maths
