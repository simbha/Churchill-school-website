        <h1>Newsletter - 30th January 2013</h1>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>Next week’s theme is Lent. With Shrove Tuesday falling in our half term break, children
        will be making pancakes on <strong>7th February</strong>. The Reading Rooms in Churchill will be serving
        pancakes on <strong>Tuesday 12th February</strong> from <strong>2.30-4.30pm</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Football: <strong>Joachim Hullah</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y2</span>) and
        <strong>William Clamp</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y4</span>). Well done for continuing
        to play in such poor weather conditions.</p>

        <h2>Puzzle Day</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> had an enjoyable day using educational games and
        puzzles to inspire their interest in maths. Children worked in small teams competing against
        each other to hone their maths skills. A super, amazing, challenging day was had by
        all. Thank you to the PTA for funding this event.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> Assembly</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span>’s assembly followed the form of a newspaper
        report. Children picked out the highlights of their year. The children presented
        journalistic reports on their Business Enterprise challenge, their visit to the SS Great
        Britain as well as facts on Ancient Greece. Thank you to the parents for joining us for the
        assembly.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>Tea, coffee and delicious cakes were enjoyed by all those who braved the ‘icy
        weather’. Thank you to everyone who was able to make it, we raised <strong>£86.00</strong>
        which will be put to good use.</p>

        <h2>Measure Your Feet Day</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> had fun measuring their feet! They measured their
        feet in centimetres and millimetres and worked out how to record the measurement as a
        decimal. They then made a bar graph to compare the size of children’s feet in <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> with <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>. The children
        then discussed their findings.</p>

        <h2>Popcorn Day</h2>

        <p>Children enjoyed eating their homemade popcorn last week. Thank you to the PTA for
        providing the ingredients and Mrs. Churchill for ‘popping’ it.</p>

        <h2>Just For Fun</h2>

        <p>On <strong>Tuesday</strong> we ate homemade chocolate cake. Although we are all trying to
        be healthy an occasional treat is always welcome. Watch out for a charming photo in this
        week’s Mercury.</p>

        <h2>Romeo &amp; Juliet</h2>

        <p>The Old Vic Theatre Group put on a fantastic performance for <span
        class="yeargroup">KS2</span> children on <strong>Monday</strong>. Children and staff were
        spellbound although some of <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> thought there was too much
        kissing!  A huge thank you to the PTA for funding this event. <span class="yeargroup">Years
        5 and 6</span> from Wrington Primary School joined us.</p>
