        <h1>Newsletter - 30th January 2013</h1>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>Next week’s theme is Lent. With Shrove Tuesday falling in our half term break, children
        will be making pancakes on 7th February. The Reading Rooms in Churchill will be serving
        pancakes on Tuesday 12th February from 2.30-4.30pm.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Football: Joachim Hullah (Y2 ) and William Clamp (Y4). Well done for continuing to play
        in such poor weather conditions.</p>

        <h2>Puzzle Day</h2>

        <p>KS2 had an enjoyable day using educational games and puzzles to inspire their interest in
        maths. Children worked in small teams competing against each other to hone their maths
        skills. A super, amazing, challenging day was had by all. Thank you to the PTA for funding
        this event.</p>

        <h2>Year 5 Assembly</h2>

        <p>Year 5’s assembly followed the form of a newspaper report. Children picked out the
        highlights of their year. The children presented journalistic reports on their Business
        Enterprise challenge, their visit to the SS Great Britain as well as facts on Ancient
        Greece. Thank you to the parents for joining us for the assembly.</p>

        <h2>Year 5 T@3</h2>

        <p>Tea, coffee and delicious cakes were enjoyed by all those who braved the ‘icy
        weather’. Thank you to everyone who was able to make it, we raised £86.00 which will be put
        to good use.</p>

        <h2>Measure Your Feet Day</h2>

        <p>Year 4 had fun measuring their feet! They measured their feet in centimetres and
        millimetres and worked out how to record the measurement as a decimal. They then made a bar
        graph to compare the size of children’s feet in Year 4 with Year 3. The children then
        discussed their findings.</p>

        <h2>Popcorn Day</h2>

        <p>Children enjoyed eating their homemade popcorn last week. Thank you to the PTA for
        providing the ingredients and Mrs. Churchill for ‘popping’ it.</p>

        <h2>Just For Fun</h2>

        <p>On Tuesday we ate homemade chocolate cake. Although we are all trying to be healthy an
        occasional treat is always welcome. Watch out for a charming photo in this week’s
        Mercury.</p>

        <h2>Romeo &amp; Juliet</h2>

        <p>The Old Vic Theatre Group put on a fantastic performance for KS2 children on
        Monday. Children and staff were spellbound although some of Year 6 thought there was too
        much kissing!  A huge thank you to the PTA for funding this event. Years 5 and 6 from
        Wrington Primary School joined us.</p>

        <h2>Heart Foundation</h2>

        <p>This Friday will be non school uniform day. Wear something RED, scarf, socks, nails etc.,
        for ‘Rock up in Red’. All proceeds (we suggest a 50p donation) to the British Heart
        Foundation.</p>

        <h2>KS1 End Of Term Service</h2>

        <p>Next Tuesday (5th February) is the KS1 Service at St. Mary’s Church in Langford. Parents
        are welcome to join us and we would also appreciate help walking the children to the church,
        leaving at 9.15am. Tea and coffee will be served in the library afterwards.</p>

        the school to your children. This will be followed by workshops where you will be able to
        practice what you have learnt!</p>

        <h2>Pancake Day</h2>
