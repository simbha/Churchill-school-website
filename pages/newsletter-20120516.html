        and the playground for <strong>£1</strong> and can be returned to these places. First prize

        <h2>Race For Life</h2>

        <p>Congratulations to everyone who took part last weekend and those who will take part in
        similar activities in the future. </p>


        <h2>Lunchtimes</h2>

        <p>We are trialling new lunchtime arrangements over the next weeks. Full details to
        follow.</p>

        <h2>A Child’s View Of Lunchtime</h2>

        <p><strong>Scarlett</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> said she likes being
        able to play with her friends, and <strong>Sophia</strong>, also in <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 2</span>, said she too likes to play with friends but sometimes her
        brother teases her!</p>

        <h2>Parent Questionnaires </h2>

        <h3>…Could Do Better</h3>

        <p>Support for ‘middle groups’ in each class. Through the extra support that we give to all
        of our classes all children benefit. When small groups of children work outside the
        classroom the class becomes smaller, therefore giving class teachers more time with each
        pupil. Twice weekly each class has an extra teacher working with them to ensure more
        individual attention for all children.</p>

        <h3>What We Do Well</h3>

        <p>One family said “We like all the extras that the school do”. Another said “I think the
        teachers are kind and professional. They work hard and they and their classroom assistants
        try to create a happy and creative learning environment”.</p>

        <h2>PTA Photo</h2>

        <p>Last week the children had a whole school photo taken. This will be processed and given
        to each child on the day of our Jubilee Party at school on <strong>Thursday 31st
        May</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Lost</h2>

        <p>On <strong>Wednesday</strong> last week whilst playing rounders <strong>Samuel
        Mees</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y1</span>) lost a new pair of grey, M&amp;S school
        trousers with his name in. If you think you may have them please return them to <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 1</span>. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Arsenal At The Sports Centre</h2>

        <p>Arsenal Soccer Schools will be running a course on <strong>Friday 8th June</strong> from
        <strong>10.00am-1.00pm</strong> at Churchill Sports Centre. To book please go to <a
