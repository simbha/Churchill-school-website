<h1>Churchill Primary School PTA Newsletter</h1>

<p>Welcome back to an exciting and very festive term. In a few weeks time we have our biggest fund 
raiser of the year - the Christmas Fayre. I know this is a busy term for everyone but any offers of help 
you can give us either leading up to the Fayre or on the day is very gratefully received - we really 
can't do this without your help. There are also some additional exciting events to look forward to both 
this term and into next year. </p>

<h2>School Disco 			November 18</h2>
<p>As normal Key stage 1  5.00 - 6.00 pm and Key stage 2  6.15 - 7.15 pm. Cost Â£2 per child to include free 
squash</p>
<h2>Christmas Fayre countdown</h2>
<p>Saturday 4th December 12-4p.m CHRISTMAS FAYRE</p>
<p>Thursday, 2nd December MUFTI DAY in exchange for tombola items, books and toys.</p>
<p>Friday, 3rd December Cake Donations for the tea and coffee stall</p>

<p>Christmas Hamper - This year we will be having a prize to the best decorated class hamper box. Each 
class will decorate their class box in school. We will be putting up lists for items required outside each of 
the classrooms and we'd be grateful if you could sign up to donating one of the items from your child's 
class hamper list. </p>
<p>Promise Auction - every year the promise auction helps raise extra funds at the Christmas Fayre and 
we can guarantee some fantastic promises. However we need your help to make this a success. We will 
be asking for donations of promises - anything from baking a special cake, babysitting etc to a 
weekend break away, the sky's the limit! If you know of any local companies or businesses that would 
also donate a promise then that would be great too.  See your class rep, any member of the PTA or 
Liz/Jackie in the school office if you can help.</p>
<h2>Some dates for your diary next year...</h2>
<p>January 29 Quiz Night</p>
