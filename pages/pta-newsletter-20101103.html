<h1>Churchill Primary School PTA Newsletter</h1>

<p>Welcome back to an exciting and very festive term. In a few weeks time we have our biggest fund 
raiser of the year - the Christmas Fayre. I know this is a busy term for everyone but any offers of help 
you can give us either leading up to the Fayre or on the day is very gratefully received - we really 
can't do this without your help. There are also some additional exciting events to look forward to both 
this term and into next year. </p>

<h2 id="disco">School Disco</h2>
<p>A school disco will be held on November 18. Times, as normal, are:</p>
<table>
<tr><th class="yeargroup">Key stage 1</th><td>17:00-18:00</td></tr>
<tr><th class="yeargroup">Key stage 2</th><td>18:15-19:15</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Cost will be Â£2 per child, to include free squash</p>

<h3>Christmas Hamper</h3>
<p>This year we will be having a prize to the best decorated class hamper box. Each class will
decorate their class box in school. We will be putting up lists for items required outside each of
the classrooms and we'd be grateful if you could sign up to donating one of the items from your
child's class hamper list. </p>
<h3>Promise Auction</h3>
<p>Every year the promise auction helps raise extra funds at the Christmas Fayre and we can
guarantee some fantastic promises. However we need your help to make this a success. We will be
asking for donations of promises - anything from baking a special cake, babysitting etc to a weekend
break away, the sky's the limit! If you know of any local companies or businesses that would also
donate a promise then that would be great too.  See your class rep, any member of the PTA or
Liz/Jackie in the school office if you can help.</p>
