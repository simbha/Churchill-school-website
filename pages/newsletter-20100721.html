        <h1>Newsletter - 21st July 2010</h1>

        <p>This school year has sped by and once again it is time to thank all members of the school community for your
        support, encouragement and hard work that help to make our school such a special place to be.</p>

        <p>We wish all the pupils who will be starting in new schools next term every happiness. We wish Mrs. Keenan a
        full and active retirement and thank her for her 14 years of hard work in our school office; she will be greatly
        missed. Miss Higgins will be starting her Deputy Head post in September and although she will be missed it is a
        wonderful opportunity for her to take advantage of.</p>

        <p>The PTA will put this to good use, enabling us to buy a set of video cameras for classes throughout the

        <p>We would just like to say what a pleasure it has been working at Churchill Primary School. We will have
        many happy memories of the children and the staff and we are sure our successors (Mrs Folkes as Administrator,
        Mrs Baber as Bursar and Miss Roberts as Foundation Stage teacher) will have as much enjoyment in their roles as
        we have had.  Thank you for your friendship and support.</p>
