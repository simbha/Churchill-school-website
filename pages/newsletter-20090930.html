        <h2>Have Your Lost Some Glasses?</h2>
        <p>We have  three pairs of spectacles in the school office.  Have you or your child mislaid any?  Please 
pop in and check if you think you have lost any.</p>

       
        <h2>Dinner Money</h2>
        <p>Please may we remind parents that  should you wish to pay for school dinners until 23rd October, 
the sum of £70.20 should be sent to the school office  at the beginning of term.  Cheques payable to 
"North Somerset Council" please.  Any credits will be carried forward to the following half term.  
Should you wish to pay weekly, dinner money should be sent to the school office each Monday of 
the week your child requires dinners (£1.95 per day - £9.75 per week).  Thank you.</p>

       
        <h2>Dates List</h2>
        <p>I hope you all received the replacement "green" dates list.  There were just  three changes:  the 
children return to school after half term on Monday 2nd November and the dates for the KS2 
Christmas productions are now 8th and 9th December.  Apologies for the confusion!</p>

<h2>Pta Quiz And Curry Evening</h2>
<p>A huge "thank you" to the PTA for organising such a lovely evening!  Thank you also to all those 
people who supported the event and enjoyed the delicious curry!  All funds raised by our hard 
working PTA are used to benefit your children so please try to come along to future events.  Don't 
forget the PTA A.G.M. on October 13th at 8.00 p.m here at school.  Pop in and find out more about 
the great work of our PTA.</p>

   <h2>Harvest</h2>

school at 12.00 p.m.  If you only have children in KS2 please come along at 12.30 p.m.</p>
