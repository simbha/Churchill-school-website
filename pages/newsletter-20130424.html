        <h1>Newsletter - 24th April 2013</h1>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>This week we have been celebrating generosity and learning about St. George’s Day. We
        have a very generous parent body in school who constantly support us; our ‘garden group’,
        our PTA, our parent helpers and so many more, so a huge thank you from all of the
        staff. Next week our theme for worship will be Miracles.</p>

        <h2>Church Inspection</h2>

        <p>This week we celebrated our Outstanding Inspection with the
        children. <strong>Mrs. Holmes</strong> baked an amazing cake in the shape of a church which
        the children all ate with gusto.</p>

        <h2>OfSTED</h2>

        <p>We are now awaiting our monitoring report from <strong>Jane Neeche</strong>, HMI. In the
        meantime we continue our work to improve maths across the school including a twilight
        training session for staff which will be led by North Somerset on Thursday. </p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done to <strong>Callum</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Reception</span> and
        <strong>Sam Ashford</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> who were the
        footballers of the week. We will be giving out ‘double school certificates’ next Tuesday.
        </p>

        <h2>Spelling and Reading Workshop</h2>

        <p><strong>Mrs. Grant</strong>, our literacy co-ordinator, will be leading a reading and
        spelling evening on <strong>Thursday, 25th April</strong> starting at
        <strong>6.30pm</strong> in the school hall. Come and learn more about how we teach reading
        and spelling across the school and find out how you can support your child’s
        learning. Because of class teaching commitments we can only offer this event after
        school. We will follow up the meeting with an information sheet for all parents.</p>

        <h2>Tell A Story Day – Friday 26th April</h2>

        <p>We will be using our whole school worship time, <strong>9.10-9.30am</strong>, to share
        stories with children. Four stories will be taking place in different parts of the school,
        so if you would like to join us please link with your child’s class. At break and lunchtime
        we will be telling more stories using our lovely amphitheatre and pergola areas. Stories are
        a hugely important way of increasing children’s vocabulary, so we ask you to promote books
        and reading at home.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Mini-Tennis </h2>

        <p>The mini-tennis planned for this <strong>Friday</strong> has been cancelled due to low
        interest from other cluster schools.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> Trip To St. Fagan’s</h2>

        <p>Last Wednesday <span class="yeargroup">Class 2</span> went to St. Fagan’s Open Air Museum
        in South Wales. We had great fun looking at different buildings throughout the ages and what
        they were used for. The highlight of the day was having a demonstration about shopping in
        the olden days by <strong>Mrs. Evans</strong>. Alfie said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“I enjoyed the red house the most as it was the poshest!”</p></blockquote>

        <p><strong>Mitu</strong> loved going over the Severn Bridge to get to Wales and
        <strong>Michael</strong> enjoyed the watermill. The museum is free to enter so if you have a
        spare day during the holidays <span class="yeargroup">Class 2</span> recommend it as a super
        day out for all the family!  Just remember it is mainly outdoors, so a fine weather day
        would be best.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> Trip To Caerleon</h2>

        <p><strong>Mary</strong> and <strong>Iris-May</strong> reported on <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 3’s</span> trip to Caerleon and had an amazing time seeing Roman
        ruins. “We tried on some very heavy armour and a helmet. The Romans would have carried all
        this and more!” they reminisced. We just want to say a massive thank you to all the adults
        who came with us.</p>

        <h2>St. Georges Day</h2>

        <p>We celebrated St. George’s Day together, our round table has a stone dragon and we are
        encouraging children to design a dragon skin.</p>

        <h2>Norman</h2>

        <p>It is with sadness that we said ‘goodbye’ to Norman our Bearded Dragon this week. We held
        a short remembrance service and a small group of children created a lovely memory poster of
        Norman.</p>

        <h2>North Somerset Arts Week</h2>

        <p>One of the venues for the Arts Week is St. John’s Church with various local artists
