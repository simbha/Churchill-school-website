        <h2 id="walk">Walk to School Week</h2>

        <p>Donâ€™t forget it is Walk to School Week next week.  You can park in the Stag and Hounds Car Park and take a
        brisk walk to school with your children!</p>

        <p>I thought it would be a nice idea if, during the week, each class brought in their bikes, scooters, etc and
        were allowed to ride them in the playground at break time. (This would only work if we could use the playing
        field so it is weather dependant).</p>

        <h2 id="sports-day">Exercise Party</h2>

        <p>Next Friday we are hosting Sports Day and the Exercise Party will be helping.  Also, we need some parents to
        help, so if you can help, please could you fill in the slip below and come to school at 1 p.m.</p>

        <p>Thank you from The Exercise Party in Class 4.</p>
