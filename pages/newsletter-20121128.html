        <h2>Green Day</h2>

        <p>In addition to a green top or bottoms, get those wellies and waterproofs at the ready!
        At <strong>10.00 am</strong> this <strong>Friday</strong> morning, the whole school will be
        joining our tree warden, <strong>Mrs Johns</strong> and other members of our village
        community as they plant trees on the green behind the school.  If you would like to join us
        and can help walk the children to the green please let your child’s class teacher know.  We
        will be leaving school just before <strong>9.45am</strong>.  When we return to school, we
        will be investigating our native trees. Do you know your alder from your ash or your horse
        chestnut from your sweet chestnut?</p>

        <h2>Youth Speaks Competition</h2>

        <p>Last Friday <strong>Emily</strong>, <strong>William</strong> and <strong>Archie</strong>
        in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> took part in the Rotary Club Youth Speaks
        competition. They entertained the audience with a very informative speech about Guide Dogs
        and asked them to consider whether there should be some government funding for this
        wonderful organisation. We congratulate them on a superb performance and on behalf of the
        team, we’d also like to say thank you to Mrs Penfold for her hard work, enthusiasm, support
        and smiles!</p>

        <div id="mufti">
        <h2>Mufti Day</h2>

        <p><strong>Friday, 7th December</strong> is Mufti day and in exchange for an item for the
        tombola or cakes you don’t have to wear school uniform. Mufti is a day for organisations
        that usually wear uniforms and is a ‘dressing down’ day. Did you know - the word has been
        used by the British army since 1816 and is thought to derive from the vaguely Eastern style
        dressing gowns and tasseled caps worn by off-duty officers in the early 19th century?</p>
        </div>
