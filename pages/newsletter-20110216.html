<h2>Parking </h2>

<p>We have had some concerns from the community about the way in which parents are parking when collecting their children including allowing them to get out of cars into the road. Please be aware that the Highway Code states:
Rule No. 242 You MUST NOT leave your vehicle or trailer in a dangerous position or where it causes any unnecessary obstruction of the road.
Rule No. 243 DO NOT stop or park opposite or within 10 metres (32 feet) of a junction, except in an authorised parking space.</p>
