<h2>Parking </h2>

<p>We have had some concerns from the community about the way in which parents are parking when collecting their children including allowing them to get out of cars into the road. Please be aware that the Highway Code states:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Rule No. 242</strong> You MUST NOT leave your vehicle or trailer in a dangerous position or where it causes any unnecessary obstruction of the road.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Rule No. 243</strong> DO NOT stop or park opposite or within 10 metres (32 feet) of a junction, except in an authorised parking space.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Fact Of The Week</h2>

<p>Provided this week by <strong>Lucy Slingsby</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Cinderella is known as Tuna in Finland"!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Assembly Theme</h2>

<p>The theme for assembly after half term will be "Jesus the Healer".</p>
