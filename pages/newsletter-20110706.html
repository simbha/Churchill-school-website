	<h2>St. John the Baptist - Picnic</h2>

	<p><strong>Ben</strong> and <strong>William</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year
	4</span> wrote:</p>

	<blockquote><p>“Churchill Primary School went for a whole school picnic at Windmill Hill. We
	were celebrating St. John the Baptist and learnt about how he baptised Jesus. We also learnt
	about how John the Baptist died. Each class designed and carried their own shield based on
	his story and Mrs. Smallwood, from St. Johns Church, said the grace. We thought it was an
	exciting way to learn and celebrate St. John the Baptist Day”. </p></blockquote>

	<h2>Certificates</h2>

	she was given the wrong surname.</p>
