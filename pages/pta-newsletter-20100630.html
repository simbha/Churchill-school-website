        <h1>PTA Newsletter - June 2010</h1>

        <h2>PTA Newsletter</h2>

        <p>The Summer fayre is less than 2 weeks away and we are working hard to try and make this our best summer fayre
        yet. We thought it might be helpful to give out some reminders of the key dates and other helpful
        information.</p>

        <dl class="diary">
          <dt>Friday 2nd July</dt><dd>Items for the tombola stall to be bought into school this Friday please.</dd>
          <dt>Friday 9th July</dt><dd>Mufti day in return for cakes and biscuits for the cake stall and also any books
          or toys (in good condition please) for the toys stall.</dd>
          <dt>Other Donations</dt><dd>We are still looking for donations of unwanted crockery, it can have chips, empty
          boxes and books and toys. These can be brought in at any time.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Arts &amp; crafts Show</h2>

        <p>Last years arts and craft event was so popular it's back by demand and we are holding our second arts and
        craft show at the fayre. All entries need to be taken to school between 3.30 - 6p.m on Friday 9th July. I'm
        afraid due to time constraints and judging we will not be able to accept entries outside of this time.</p>

        <h2>5 a side football tournament</h2>

        <p>At the fayre this year we will be holding a children's 5 a side football tournament. All teams will need to
        register at 2.15p.m on the school field ready for the tournament to start from 3p.m. England may not be in the
        world cup but how about showing your soccer skills off in our fun footy tournament! There will be different
        competitions for the different ages. Teams to be made up of children from the same year. Start getting your
        teams together now!</p>

        <h2>Children's school Calendar</h2>

        <p>Over the past few weeks the children have all been working on their self portraits which will go into our
        school calendar to be on sale at the fayre. This calendar will run over the school academic year and as well as
        fantastic self portraits it will hold all the key term dates etc. The calendars will be available at the fayre
        at the bargain price of £2.50 or if you would like to bulk buy for relatives etc then 5 for £10.</p>

        <h2>End of term disco</h2>

        <p>Our final disco of the year will be held on Thursday 15th July. As usual KS1 5-6p.m and KS2 6.15-7.15p.m £2
        per child to include free drinks.</p>

        <h2>Help still needed</h2>

        <p>Thank you to all those people who have already offered to help in many ways at the fayre but we are still
        looking for more help so if you haven't already done so we'd really appreciate it if you could offer a small
        amount of time to help make this a really successful event. Please see your class rep or any member of the
        PTA.</p>

        <h2>And finally..</h2>

        <p>If you have any more budding millionaires out there who've grown their pounds could we please have all monies
        in asap please. Also, anyone who was unable to take part if you could please return your pound to your class
        teacher who can mark you as having returned the money. We will let you know how much this endeavour has raised
        but the children who have taken part have had some fantastic ideas, experiences and really inspiring money
        making ways - watch out Alan Sugar! Well done to you all.</p>
