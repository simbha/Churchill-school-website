        <h1>A message from Avon Fire and Rescue Service</h1>

        <p>During the festive season Avon Fire &amp; Rescue Service (AF&amp;RS) is encouraging people to Keep Warm, Keep
        Safe. During the cold winter weather electric heaters, open fires and electric blankets are the sort of items in
        the home which can cause fires to start if not used correctly.  Throughout December you can learn more about
        fire safety with the AF&amp;RS advent calendar which can be found at www.avonfire.gov.uk.  Remember working
        smoke alarms are a lifesaver – please keep your children, family and loved ones safe this year by making sure
        you have a working smoke detector on every storey of your home. </p>

        <h1>Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary Newsletter</h1>

        <p>We are sending home a newsletter today from Avon &amp; Somerset Police containing information for parents.</p>

        <h1>Help with your home PC</h1>

        <p>Winternet Designs, a recently founded local company providing home and business PC support, Web design and
        print design services to the local area, has generously offered to donate 5% of all profits from sales made from
        the flyer recently sent home to parents, back to school.  Please quote “School Flyer” when ordering.</p>

        <h1>Farewell/Welcome</h1>

        <p>Today we said a fond “farewell” to Ms Sarah Joskey, Mrs Helen Wright and Miss Leanne Dyke.  We wish them
        every success for the future.  They will be greatly missed.  We also welcome Mrs Lesley Grant who will replace
        Ms Joskey and Miss Helen Mullins our new Class 5 teacher who will start with us next term.</p>

        <h1>And finally...</h1>

        <p>My colleagues and I wish you all a happy and peaceful Christmas and a wonderful new year.  We look forward to
        seeing you all on Monday 4th January, 2010.</p>
