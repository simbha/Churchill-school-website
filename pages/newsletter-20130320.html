        <h1>Newsletter - 20th March 2013</h1>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>The theme for the first week after the holiday will be Springtime surprises.</p>

        <h2>Special Church Services </h2>

        <p>Don’t forget Reverend Kate Sax will be holding a very special service for Palm Sunday on
        24th March at St. John’s. Why not go along and find out more about Jesus entering Jerusalem
        on a donkey.</p>

        <p>St.Mary’s Church will be holding an Easter workshop for children on Good Friday (29th)
        10.00am-12.00 noon to include a giant Easter egg hunt.</p>

        <p>All our local churches will be celebrating Easter together at Churchill Methodist Church
        on Easter Sunday (31st) 10.45 for 11.15am. We hope you will join us, from the Churchill
        churches.</p>

        <h2>Parent Questionnaires</h2>

        <p>Thank you for the questionnaires we have received, PLEASE return any remaining ones by
        the end of the week. Thank you to the parents who said they enjoy our ‘Special Days’ and the
        ones who wanted to know more about our Ofsted report and the progress we have made. After
        our Ofsted inspection, which highlighted improvements needed, we put together an action plan
        to take our school ‘back to good’ over the coming school year. Ofsted are supposed to send
        Her Majesty’s Inspector (HMI) to visit the school 4-6 weeks after the inspection to monitor
        planning and progress. We are still awaiting our HMI visit! Governors have complained to
        Ofsted and we understand that the HMI visit will now take place in Term 5. Once that is
        completed we will organise a parent’s evening to share the HMI findings and discuss all
        areas that parents wish to raise.</p>

        <h2>Statatory Inspection Of Anglican Schools (SIAS)</h2>

        <p>Yesterday we had a SIAS inspection of our school. SIAS inspection reports provides a
        different but complementary perspective on church schools in relation to Ofsted’s
        findings. SIAS inspections may be either concurrent with the Ofsted Section 5 inspection or
        held after the Ofsted inspection. The principal objective of the inspection is to evaluate
        the distinctiveness and effectiveness of the school as a church school.</p>

        <p>Towards this objective, inspectors seek answers to three key questions:-</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How well does the school, through its distinctive Christian character, meet the needs
          of all learners?</li>

          <li>What is the impact of collective worship on the school community?</li>

          <li>How effective are the leadership and management of the school as a church school?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The report will be issued at the start of term 5 and we look forward to sharing the
        findings with you then. </p>

        <p>Thank you to the staff, Governors, parents and children who spoke with the inspector and
        shared their views of Churchill Primary School.</p>

        <h2>World Book Day</h2>

        <p>Last Thursday our classrooms and corridors were filled with many weird and wonderful book
        characters!  From a Womble, Dorothy and Black Beauty to Harry, Hermione and Professor
        McGonigal, Mr Gum and a Gangster Grannie. Lots of classic fictional characters stood
        alongside contemporary ones.  After a parade to show off their outfits, the children shared
        their favourite books and recommended good reads.  Their enthusiasm and excitement spilled
        into the playground too as we tried to spot Where’s Wally!</p>

        <h2>Red Nose Day </h2>

        <p>A massive £430.74 was raised last Friday on Red Nose Day. The office was able to sell
        three boxes of noses, cakes made and sold at breaktime. Staff and children alike came in
        their nightclothes. A huge thank you to ALL who joined in and had a great day. A special
        thank you to Mrs. Holdaway and Mrs. Churchill for organising the event.</p>

        <h2>Year 4 Class Assembly</h2>

        <p>Thank you to Year 4 for their informative and fun class assembly. We all learnt lots of
        new things about Egyptian times and ceremonies. Well done Year 4 team!</p>

        <h2>Reception T@3</h2>

        <p>With a superb selection of cakes and cookies it was no wonder that reception’s T@3 was a
        success, raising £177!The football signed by Bristol City players was a sought after prize –
        congratulations to Thomas Risk, the lucky winner.</p>

        profits will go to our maths fund.</p>
