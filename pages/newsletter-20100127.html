        <h1>Newsletter - 27th January 2010</h1> 
		
        <p>Spring seems to be on its way - Snow Drops are tentatively popping up their heads in the school 
garden and the Anemones which Mr Anderson planted are in flower.</p>

        <h2>Special Accolades</h2>
        
		<p>This week the SMSA cup went to Mary Hemmings for her excellent collaboration in playground 
games.  The Citizens Cup was awarded to Stanley Hemmings for his good manners, caring nature 
and thoughtfulness.</p>

<h2>Permission Slips - Years 1,3,4,5 And 6</h2>

<p>Please complete the slip of paper with this letter 
EVEN IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED ONE BEFORE - so we can check and update our records 
for your child.  The Home School Agreement details will be posted on the school website if you 
wish to review them.  Please return the slip by Monday February 1st - thank you.</p>

<h2>Raising Funds</h2>

<p>A variety of new toys have been donated to the school and the School Council will be selling these 
on Friday (29th January) at break time.  Small toys cost 20p and the largest ones will be Â£1.50.  
Please ask your child to  bring their money in a named purse or envelope.  Funds raised will be split 
between our School and Woodford Primary School in South Africa.</p>

<h2>It's That Time Again!</h2>

<p>February 10th is "Walk to School Day".  It would be fantastic if the majority of children could walk 
on that day.  Please remember to use the Stag and Hounds Car Park and the back gate.</p>

<h2>Nice Bubbles</h2>

<p>A huge "thank you" to the PTA for financing our visiting "Bubble Scientist" this week.  Key Stage 
1 are in for a treat on Friday!  Children learnt so much and some pictures will be on the website 
very soon.</p>

<h2>Glorious Tudors</h2>

<p>Class 4 shared all that they had learned about the Tudors, using some innovative presentations, 
including a Quiz Show, painting, play and "Antiques Road Show".  Well done to all of them!</p>

<h2>Finally The Football Report</h2>

<p>Whilst I was at a school football tournament that was held at Wyvern School, we played 4 matches; 
after we played the last match I was approached by one of the coaches there.  He said "Hey mate 
you're an excellent player and would you like to join the North Somerset football team". When he 
asked me I replied "yes!" with excitement and I was really pleased with myself.  A couple of weeks 
later they emailed with dates of the training session to meet all the other players.  I went along and I 
was the only year 5, all the rest were year 6.  He said to me "Don't be intimidated by the older ones, 
just play your normal game".  I really enjoyed myself and I am waiting for the next training session 
and match.</p>
