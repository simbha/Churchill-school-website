        <h1>Newsletter - 17th June 2010</h1>

        <p>Here is chapter 2 of our weekly newsletter.</p>

        <h2>Inset Training</h2>

        <p>All teachers and learning support staff had an inspiring three days – (photos on website soon!).  We worked
        together to look at how we could prepare our pupils for their future role in society.  The Inset days focused on
        creating links between the subjects we teach.  Please do let us know if your children talk to you about changes
        in their class work.</p>

        <h2>Parent Working Party</h2>

        <p>The Parent Working Party have been working on the information gathered from your questionnaire returns and
        are currently looking at alternative methods of communication.  Watch out for their letter soon.  Two parents
        have also started to re-organise the library and the PTA have given us funds for the face lift.  Thank you to
        all of those people who make this school such a lovely place to be.</p>

        <h2>September Classes</h2>

        <p>Each year we look at our staffing structures and see how we can best place staff for the benefit of your
        children.  This September we have two new members of staff, Rachel Moore who will teach Year 6 and Debbie
        Roberts who will teach Foundation Stage.  Both teachers will be in school this term to work with the children.
        Each class has a team of people working with them and the table on the next page shows the main people your
        child will be working with next year.</p>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>

        <dl>
          <dt>PPA Teachers:</dt>
          <dd>Each full time teacher is entitled to one afternoon a week out of the class to plan and prepare lessons
          and assess pupils’ progress.</dd>

          <dt>Split Literacy/Numeracy Teachers:</dt>
          <dd>Support the main class teacher once a week so that the class can split in two smaller groups allowing more
          individual attention for the children.</dd>

          <dt>Learning Support Assistants:</dt>
          <dd>We have a highly qualified enthusiastic group of “ladies” who carry out a myriad of roles from changing
          reading books to cooking and working with groups in many areas of the curriculum.</dd>

          <dt>Admin Assistants:</dt>
          <dd>Admin Assistants help in classes with administrative tasks for example – paper work, updating records and
          putting up displays.</dd>

          <dt>Able Pupil Teacher:</dt>
          <dd>Mrs Penfold works with numerous groups of children in Key stage 2.</dd>

          <dt>Supply Teachers:</dt>
          <dd>Fully qualified teachers who come to teach the children if a member of the class team is not available.</dd>
        </dl>
