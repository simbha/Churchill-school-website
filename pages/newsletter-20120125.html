        <h1>Newsletter - 25th January 2012</h1>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>This week our theme is all about sharing and this will continue into next week.</p>

        <h2>Future for Science</h2>

        <p><strong>William Pearce</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y5</span>) said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“On Tuesday we had a visit from a scientist who told us lots of interesting
        facts about science which included balancing a football on a leaf blower. Everyone really
        enjoyed the show”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Chocolate Cake Day </h2>

        <h3>Friday 27th January</h3>

        <p>We are all looking forward to sampling a variety of cakes and learning about the
        ingredients in them. We will then conduct a survey to find out which was the most
        popular.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Congratulations to the following children:-</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Reception</th><td>Lily Spry</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 1</th><td>Tammy Holmes</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 2</th><td>Maisie Johns</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 4</th><td>Ben Wheeler</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 5</th><td>Jack Panicucci</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 6</th><td>Phoebe Samuel</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Football</th><td>Joshua Mees, <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span></td></tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Maisie Johns</strong> has also won a gold medal for gymnastics. Well done
        Maisie!</p>

        <h2>Hat Day</h2>

        <p>What a wonderful display of hats we had on Friday it was so difficult to choose as they
        were all so good. The following children were winners in their class:
        <strong>Jude Milton</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">YR</span>),
        <strong>Mitu Panicucci</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y1</span>),
        <strong>Maisie Johns</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y2</span>),
        <strong>Oliver Vosper</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y3</span>),
        <strong>Louise Maitland-Round</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y4</span>),
        <strong>Ben Corfield</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y5</span>),
        <strong>Lucy Slingsby</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y6</span>).</p>

        <p>Children learnt about the importance of taking care of their heads and exercising their
        brains – so cycle helmets on every ride and focused learning daily.</p>

        <h2>Netball Match v St. Anne’s</h2>

        <p>Congratulations to the <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> netball team who won their
        match yesterday <strong>7-4</strong>. Everyone played very well and made
        <strong>Mrs. Rowtcliff</strong> very proud, well done!</p>

        <div id="puzzle">
        <h2>Puzzle Week</h2>

        <p>Next week we will be giving the children opportunities to try different types of puzzles
        including jigsaws, Sudoku and word puzzles. May be you could try some at home as well.</p>

        <h2>Governor's Profile </h2>

        <h3>Tristan Wilson – Parent Governor</h3>

        <blockquote><p>“I have two children, one at the Primary school and the other at Churchill
        Academy. I wanted to become a school governor as I wished to support the running of the
        school and learn more about my children’s education.</p>

        <p>“I am Chair of the Management Committee, as well as having special responsibility for
        history and geography.</p>

        <p>“I studied Archaeology and Anthropology at Trinity College, Cambridge after which I
        trained and qualified as a Chartered Accountant. I now work for Airbus in North Bristol.</p>

        <p>“My other interests include running, reading and maintaining an interest in history and
        archaeology, which I also do through being Treasurer of the Langford History
        Group.”</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Online Child Protection</h2>

        <p>Accompanying the paper version of the newsletter is a leaflet which has been supplied by
        Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary called “Tackling Safety” . This is specifically aimed at
        children, giving them guidelines on how to keep themselves safe. This includes online safety,
        home and road safety and more.</p>

        <h2>Burns Night</h2>

        <p>Thank you to <strong>Mrs. Campbell</strong> for her contribution to our Robbie Burns
        assembly. I wonder how many children enjoyed their first taste of haggis.</p>

        <h2>Lost</h2>

        <p><strong>Mrs. Maitland-Round</strong> has lost a tea tray which is white with a
        honeysuckle picture. Has anyone seen it?</p>

        <h2>Lost Property</h2>

        <p>We do have a number of items in the lost property bin outside <span
        class="yeargroup">Class 2</span> and we sometimes have other more precious or important
        items handed into the office. If you think you may have lost something please try us!</p>
