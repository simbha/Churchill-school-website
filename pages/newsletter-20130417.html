        <h1>Newsletter - 17th April 2013</h1>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>This week we are celebrating friendships and the ‘Open the Book’ story was about The Man
        Nobody Wanted. We have also thought about what makes a good friend. Next week our topic for
        worship will be generosity.</p>

        <h2>Ofsted/Statutory Inspection Of Anglican Schools (SIAS)</h2>

        <p>We were pleased to receive several letters congratulating the school on our recent SIAS
        inspection which is equally as important as the Ofsted inspection. Here are some
        extracts:-</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Firstly from The Venerable Andy Piggott, the Archdeacon of Bath:

          <blockquote><p>“I would like to offer
          my warmest congratulations to you, your staff, governors and pupils, on the result of the
          SIAS inspection of Churchill School. To be judged as outstanding in all key areas of the
          inspection is a tribute to your leadership of the school, and the dedication of the whole
          school community.”</p></blockquote></li>

          <li>Secondly from Tess Gale, the Director of Education of the Diocese of Bath and Wells

          <blockquote><p>“The SIAS inspection focuses on the distinctiveness and inclusiveness of church schools
          and Churchill is certainly a school of which your local community can be proud. It gives
          me great pleasure to offer you our warmest congratulations on the outcome of your SIAS
          inspection last term. To be judged to be an outstanding school is a truly tremendous
          achievement, and is certainly testament to your leadership.”</p></blockquote></li>
        </ul>

        <div id="ofsted">
        <p>This week Jane Neeche, HMI, visited our school. She would like to apologise on behalf of
        Ofsted for the delay in her monitoring visit which was due to take place six weeks after our
        full Ofsted inspection. The visit was postponed because of the snow and sickness of an
        inspector. I know the lateness of this visit has caused unrest amongst parents and that was
        shared with the HMI. We will receive her full report on the progress we have made since our
        inspection in about two weeks and hard copies will be sent to you. We would be delighted to
        invite you to a parents evening on <strong>Wednesday, 8th May</strong> to share HMI findings
        and the SIAS report. Governors will be joining us for this evening.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done for your outstanding effort and consistent hard work.</p>
