        <h1>Newsletter - 23rd January 2013</h1>

        <h2>Weather Conditions</h2>

        <p>Thank you to the snow fairies or gnomes who secretly cleared paths around school at the
        weekend, with <strong>Mr. Young</strong> our caretaker off sick it was a tremendous help!
        Thank you also to <strong>Mr. Hurst</strong> for updating our website letting parents know
        the school was closed last Friday. We apologise for any inconvenience to parents but without
        enough teachers we were unable to open. If there is a likelihood of further closures please
        check the website and the local radio for information. Also please try telephoning the
        school as someone may have been able to make it in to man the phone.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>Next week’s assembly themes are based around journeys and will include Scott of the
        Antarctic, how appropriate!</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Football certificates were awarded to <strong>Joachim Hullah</strong> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y2</span>), <strong>Weston Skeates</strong> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y4</span>) and <strong>James Witchell</strong> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y5</span>). Well done.</p>

        <p>For all those in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> taking part in the National
        Cycling Standard Training Programme don’t forget you will need a roadworthy bike and most
        importantly don’t forget a helmet. If a child does not bring a helmet they will not be
        allowed to participate.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>T@3</h2>

        <p><strong>Friday</strong> is the turn of <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> to host
        T@3. Please take a relaxing break to come along and have a chat and a cuppa before you
        collect your children and stay afterwards.</p>

        <h2>World Religion Day</h2>

        <p>Children enjoyed learning from each other during our special World Religion Day service
        on Monday – sadly the weather prevented any parents from joining us. <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> had made a Jewish scroll of prayers. <span
        class="yeargroup">Year R</span> showed us how Hindus wash away their sins and <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> taught everyone about Hindu Gods. Other classes will be
        sharing later in the week.</p>

        linked to maths. We will let you know next week what we did.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="handwriting">

        story of the Elves and the Shoemaker.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>First Aid In School</h2>

        <p>Please be assured that if your child has an accident in school a number of our staff are
        paediatric first aid trained and if it is considered a significant injury you will be
        contacted. In the event of a bumped head or other body parts the child is given a sticker
        to wear and a note to go home to parents. Class teachers are informed and a child will be
        observed during the course of the day. However when children are out of sight of a member of
        staff sometimes they take off their sticker! So please check for a ‘note’ in your child’s
        bag.</p>

        In the first of a series of assemblies on World Music, pianist and educationalist Sue Curtis
        introduced us to the colourful music and dance of Spain.  She demonstrated how to use
        rhythms and harmonies to make the piano sound Spanish before playing a piece by Spanish
        composer Isaac Albeniz.</p>
