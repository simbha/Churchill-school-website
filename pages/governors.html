      <div class="governor">

	<img src="images/Sally_F.jpg" alt="Sally"/>

	<div class="governor-desc">

	  <p>I have served as a Governor here for over twenty years. My own boys were educated here
	  right through from Reception to sixth form at the Community School. One is a doctor and
	  the other an accountant and I am sure that their success has been built on the foundations
	  of their time at Churchill Primary.</p>

	  <h3>Areas of responsibility</h3>

	  <p>I am currently serving as Chair of the Governing Body, and am part of the Management
	  Committee. I also have special interest in the teaching of maths. </p>

	  <h3>Other Information</h3>

	  <p>My interest in science, food and nutrition led me to choose Dietetics as a
	  profession. I work at Weston General Hospital, where I manage a team of 10 Dieticians, and
	  in my spare time, love gardening, running and all my menagerie of animals. Why am I a
	  Governor? Because of the children, and because it is a wonderful school. I hope I can play
	  a small part in its successful future development.</p>
