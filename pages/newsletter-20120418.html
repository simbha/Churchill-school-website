        <h2>A Children’s view of lunchtimes </h2>

        <p><strong>Lola</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> commented that she liked
        the fact that everyone can play whatever they want with whoever they
        want. <strong>Sophie</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> said she liked being
        able to eat her lunch outside when it is sunny and play on the field.</p>

        <h2>Our School Library</h2>

        <p>Just a reminder that our school library is open and manned by our school librarian
        (<strong>Mrs. Vernon</strong>) two lunchtimes a week – <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span>
        <strong>Tuesday</strong> and <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span>
        <strong>Wednesday</strong>.</p>

        <p>In the next few months we also hope to extend official opening times to every afternoon
        after school. We’ll keep you posted of this development.</p>

        <p>Thanks to your support we have also been able to update our shelves with exciting new
        books. These will make their appearance slowly with a new author/genre each month.</p>

        <p>Author and book of the month for May is Cressidia Cowell’s “How to train your
        dragon”. The story asks “Can Hiccup pass the Dragon Initiation Programme with a toothless
        dragon and fight the Seadragonus Giganticus Maximus before it gobbles up every Viking on
        Berk? It’s time for Hiccup to learn how to be a Hero”. Why not borrow this book?</p>

        <p>Many of you have children who will have attended Churchill Pre-School, or take part in
        activities at Churchill Memorial Hall. Although inside the hall is in good decorative order,
        the roof, much of it still the original, (built in 1926), desperately needs renewing.  We
        have almost enough money to start work this August and are still fundraising to reach our
        target.  A Promise Auction is being held at the hall on <strong>Saturday 19th May –
        10am</strong> for viewing, bidding starts at <strong>10.30am</strong>.  Admission is free
        and there will be homemade refreshments available.  Please come along- if only for the
        experience and a piece of cake!  Alternatively, if you can’t make it and you have a
        gift/skill/service you can offer for auction I would be pleased to hear from you.  A
        Programme of Lots should be available from Churchill Post Office from <strong>10th
        May</strong>.  </p>
