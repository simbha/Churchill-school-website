<h2>Football Star Of The Future?</h2>
<p><strong>Daniel Bugg</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> has written:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I play for Somerset Football Development and yesterday I played at Ashton Gate on the main pitch. We played against a Woodspring representative team. We got changed in the home dressing room, played two games, won one and lost one in front of a crowd of cheering parents. I really enjoyed it and it was a GREAT experience".</p></blockquote>
