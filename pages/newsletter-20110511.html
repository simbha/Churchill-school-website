        <h1>Newsletter - 11th May 2011</h1>

<p>The children have had a magnificent time playing our recently donated drum kit which has replaced our round table this week. Lots of laughter, turn taking, sharing and happy moments have been enjoyed. Not quite sure how impressed Norman has been (or the office staff)!</p>

<h2>Mrs. Holdaway Walking London In Her Bra!</h2>
<p>Mrs. Holdaway, Year 1 LSA, will be taking part in the 14th Moonwalk in London this weekend, walking 26 miles, in this extraordinary moonlit marathon. Over 15,000 brave walkers will be pounding the streets of London to raise awareness and money for breast cancer. One in eight women in the UK expects to experience some form of breast cancer. Anyone wishing to donate please see Mrs. Holdaway or leave your donations in the office.</p>

<h2>Football Star Of The Future?</h2>
<p>Daniel Bugg in Year 5 has written "I play for Somerset Football Development and yesterday I played at Ashton Gate on the main pitch. We played against a Woodspring representative team. We got changed in the home dressing room, played two games, won one and lost one in front of a crowd of cheering parents. I really enjoyed it and it was a GREAT experience". Well done Daniel!</p>
