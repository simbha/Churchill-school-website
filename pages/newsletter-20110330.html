        <h1>Newsletter - 30th March 2011</h1>

	<h2>Assembly theme</h2>

	<p>The theme for next week is the Easter story – Maunday Thursday, Good Friday, Easter
	Sunday.</p>

	<h2>Fact of the week</h2>

	<p><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span>’s fact of the week is:</p>

	<blockquote><p>The pastry cross on top of the hot cross bun symbolises and reminds
	Christians of the cross that Jesus died on. Buns were traditionally eaten hot from the oven
	at breakfast time and were once sold by street vendors who sang a little song about them;
	“Hot cross buns, hot cross buns, one a penny, two a penny hot cross buns”.</p></blockquote>
