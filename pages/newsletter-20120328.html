        <h1>Newsletter - 28th March 2012</h1>

        <p>Enjoy your Easter Holiday, may it be full of smiles.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A smile costs nothing but gives a lot.</li>
          <li>It enriches those who receive without making poorer those who give.</li>
          <li>It takes a moment but the memory of it can last a long time.</li>
          <li>There is nobody who is rich or mighty that he doesn’t need one and nobody so poor that he cannot be enriched by it.</li>
          <li>A smile creates happiness, good will, peace and friendship.</li>
          <li>It brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad and is much better than medicines.</li>
          <li>It cannot be bought, borrowed, begged for or stolen. It is valueless until given away and then it becomes priceless.</li>
          <li>If you see someone sad give him a smile, for nobody needs a smile more than someone who has no more of them to give.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>Our first week of assemblies will be about sight and sounds. We are hoping to have a
        special ‘visitor’ that week!</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Very many apologies to <strong>Thomas Risk</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year
        3</span> whose name was missed off as having received a certificate. Congratulations to
        <strong>Austin Witchell</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">YR</span>) &amp; <strong>Harvey
        Ashford</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y3</span>) who received certificates at
        football.</p>

        <h2>After School Football Club</h2>

        <p>Football club will still be on this <strong>Thursday, 29th</strong> as usual.</p>

        <h2>Reception T@3</h2>

        <p>Wow! A huge thank you to all who came to support <span class="yeargroup">Year R</span>’s
        Tea@3, we raised a massive <strong>£185</strong>! Thanks to the lovely mums, dads and
        siblings who made it all possible.</p>

        <h2>Sport Relief</h2>

        <p>Thank you for supporting our Sport Relief mufti day. The coins managed to go all the way
        around <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> playground and we had a lot of fun placing the
        coins out and collecting them!  Watch this space for the final total.</p>

        <h2>Sponsored Walk</h2>

        <p><strong>£150</strong> was raised by <strong>Jacob</strong> and <strong>Daniel Long</strong>
        seafront to raise awareness about foster care. Well done boys!</p>

        <h2>Our Caretaker</h2>

        <p>Mr. Anderson will be resting ‘his leg’ and hopes to return to work on <strong>23rd
        April</strong>. In the meantime a huge thank you to some special dads who have helped out by
        mowing the lawn and fixing the boys toilets. Thank you to <strong>Mr. Hosgood</strong> who
        has been cleaning <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> and <strong>Mr. Bush</strong> who will
        be looking after the school over half term.</p>

        <h2>Sunshine = Sun Hats</h2>

        <p>If this glorious weather continues when we come back after Easter please remember to send
        a sun hat to school with your child/children. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Easter Bonnet &amp; T@3 19th April</h2>

        <p>Why not make an Easter bonnet to wear at T@3 on Thursday, 19th April? Hats simple or
        complex which reflect the Easter spirit will be judged during tea time.</p>

        <h2>Parent Questionnaires</h2>

        <p>If you haven’t yet handed in your questionnaires there is still time. The collection box
        is in the main foyer.</p>


        <h2>Lunchtimes </h2>

        <p>The children have been enjoying themselves again on the playing field in this gorgeous
        weather. </p>

        <h2>Register Now For Free School Meals </h2>

        <p>This is not something that would usually feature in the Newsletter but Free School Meals
        are very important. So please read on! Many families in the Churchill catchment are entitled
        to claim Free School Meals, but many don’t. The number of eligible families has risen
        remarkably since 2008 partly due to the great banking crisis and the ‘credit crunch’. We are
        sure there are families out there who do probably qualify but who don’t register and this is
        the purpose of this appeal. If you are in receipt of certain benefits you are likely to
        qualify and registering for Free School Meals does not affect your other entitlements. We
        would urge you to do this as soon as possible. Firstly, accessing Free School Meals can save
        you between <strong>£300 - £400</strong> per year. Secondly, if you register it is entirely up to you – and
        your child/children – if you actually take them, but please still register. Why? Registering
        for Free School Meals brings the school extra income. We use the Pupil Premium in several
        ways – to provide extra resources in school such as one-to-one intervention and
        extra-curricular activities. Registering for Free School Meals is entirely confidential so
        please telephone North Somerset Council’s School Admissions Department on <strong>01275 884014</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Country Dancing Club</h2>

        <p>Does anyone have any plain white, crew neck T-shirts sizes 26”-30” that could be donated
        to the country dancing club? Please see <strong>Mrs. Strawbridge</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Cub Open Day</h2>

        <p>A Cub open day is being held at Sandford Scout Hut on <strong>Saturday, 31st
        March</strong> from <strong>13:00 to 16:00</strong>. So any children between the ages of
        <span class="yeargroup">8 and 10 years</span> this is your chance to see what the Cub
        organisation is all about.</p>

        <h2>Wisewoods</h2>

        <p>An Easter egg hunt has been organised by Wisewoods on <strong>Sunday 7th April</strong>
