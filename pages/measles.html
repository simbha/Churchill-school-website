	<h1>MMR and measles outbreaks</h1>

	<p>28th April 2011</p>

	<p>This is to you alert you that France is currently experiencing a large outbreak of
	measles with over 3700 cases confirmed this year. Outbreaks have also been reported in
	countries bordering France and in other parts of Europe. <a

	<p>There has been a much smaller increase in confirmed cases of measles during the past
	month in the UK. The vast majority of cases have occurred in persons who are unimmunised and
	most cases are in older children attending secondary school, in students attending
	university and in adults. Many of these cases have links to cases in France. </p>

	<p>There is considerable risk that your child may catch measles if they are not protected
	against the disease. Unless your child has already received two doses of vaccine, we would
	advise you to obtain MMR vaccination before travelling to mainland Europe </p>

	<h2>Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine</h2>

	<p>Immunisation with MMR vaccine is the safest way that parents can protect their children
	against measles, mumps and rubella which are diseases that can have serious consequences for
	babies, young children, teenagers and their families. Not all people respond adequately to a
	single dose of vaccine, so to ensure greater protection, people need to receive two doses of
	MMR. Two doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine offer full protection against the
	three illnesses, provided the first dose is given from 12 months of age.</p>

	<p>In the UK two doses of MMR are usually given, the first at around 12 months and the
	second around the time of school entry. </p>

	<ul>
	  <li>If your child is older than 12 months of age and has never had MMR, please contact
	  your GP to give the first dose as soon as possible.</li>

	  <li>If your child has only had a single dose of MMR a second dose will improve the level
	  of protection.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you require further information then please do not hesitate to contact your local
	Health Protection Unit or NHS North Somerset. </p>
