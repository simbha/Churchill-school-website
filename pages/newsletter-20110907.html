	<h1>Newsletter - 7th September 2011</h1>

	<p>Welcome to a new year at Churchill Primary! We are delighted that you have trusted us
	with your child and we will strive to ensure that they have a happy and fulfilling year in
	which they will reach their full potential.</p>

	<h2 id="hsa">School rules and Home School agreement</h2>

	<p>All the children have agreed and “signed up” to our school rules and we hope you will
	remind and encourage your child to follow them:-</p>

	<h3>Our School Rules</h3>


	<ul>
	  <li>I will treat everyone as I would like them to treat me.</li>
	  <li>I will follow instructions first time.</li>
	  <li>I will move sensibly and safely around the school and always walk when inside.</li>
	  <li>I will try to do my best and let others do the same.</li>
	  <li>This is my world, I will look after everything in and around it.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>To get the most from school life we like to work in partnership, so we are sending our
	“Home School” Agreement for you to discuss with your child. Please sign the slip and return
	by <strong>Monday, 12th September</strong>; keep the agreement for reference. This agreement
	will also be on the school website.</p>

	<h2>A few housekeeping reminders</h2>

	<ul>
	  <li>Buggies need to stay in the playground; we have had all the carpets cleaned!</li>
	  <li>Healthy breaks are preferred e.g. fruit and veg – but the choice is yours.</li>
	  <li>Please collect your children from the playground to avoid congestion in the corridors.</li>
	  <li>If you have changed your contact details please let us know immediately.</li>
	  <li>If you child’s medical needs change please notify us in writing.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We try our best to look after your child so tell us straight away if you are concerned so
	we can put your mind at rest. We have 200 children who will at times squabble, tussle and
	tease each other. Part of school life is for children to learn strategies for managing
	this. We have a very good staff team here to support you, your children and each other.</p>

	<h2>Big thank you</h2>

	<p>A huge thank you from the staff for all the very generous gifts you shared at the end of
	last term and the thoughtful cards.</p>

	<h2 id="open">Open day</h2>

	<p>We will be having an Open Day for all parents on <strong>Friday, 23rd September</strong>
	from <strong>13:45-15:30</strong>, so come and enjoy visiting our classes and seeing your
	child at work. More details next week.</p>

	<h2>Dinner money</h2>

	<p>Dinner money is now <strong>£2 per day</strong>, <strong>£10 per week</strong> and for
	the first half term until <strong>Thursday 22nd October</strong> will be
	<strong>£68.00</strong>.</p>

	<h2 id="yr10">Churchill Primary 10 year celebration</h2>

	<p>We will be celebrating 10 years in Pudding Pie Lane in November and would like to have
	any photographs or memories covering this period for use on our Open Day. Please bring them
	to the office.</p>

	<h2>Music tuition</h2>

	<p>This will start week beginning <strong>Monday, 12th September</strong> so please remember
	to bring in your instruments. A separate letter to follow with final details.</p>


	<h2>Safety reminder</h2>

	<p>It has been noted that a few children are allowed to alight from cars onto the road
	side. Please make sure children get out of cars on the pavement parking side. </p>

	<h2 id="sparklers">Sparklers</h2>

	<p>Starts again <strong>Thursday 8th September</strong> exploring the story of Noah and his
	ark and why rainbows are so special. Join in the craft and song and story fun at St. Marys
	Church from <strong>10:00-11:30</strong>. All pre-school children welcome.</p>

	<h2 id="heritage">Heritage Day</h2>

	<p>This <strong>Thursday</strong> is World Heritage Day and to celebrate all UK Heritage
	sites will be free of charge to visit over the weekend. See their website for details and
	enjoy a family day out. I hear the caves in Banwell are fascinating.</p>
