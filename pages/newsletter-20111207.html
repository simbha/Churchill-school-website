        <h2>Christmas Fayre</h2>

        <p>What a fantastic Christmas Fayre! The staff, children and PTA worked very hard to prepare
        the school for this annual event, which started with the arrival of Father Christmas in a
        vintage car!</p>

        <p>The school corridors buzzed with the usual comings and goings and over <strong>£2000</strong> was made
        with <strong>£1200</strong> being made on the Promise Auction.</p>

        <p>Thank you to everyone who supported us.</p>

        <h2>How many balloons in a car?</h2>

        <p>Churchill Kids Club would like to say a big “Thank you!” to everyone who tried to guess
        how many balloons were in a car, the answer was 47. Also thank you to <strong>William
        Maitland-Round</strong> for his help on the day and the <strong>Grist family</strong> for
        the use of their car.</p>

        <h2>Aladdin </h2>

        <p>We all had a great time, the acting and singing by the students of Weston College was
