        <h1>Newsletter - 25th June 2010</h1> 

        <p>I’m sorry our letter is two days later than usual this week, but we feared that enthusiasm for football may
        mean letters wouldn’t arrive home.</p>

        <p>What a wonderful afternoon the children had at the School Sports Day on Friday!  The results were:</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Yellow</th><td>79 points</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Blue</th><td>76 points</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Green</th><td>62 points</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Red</th><td>47 points</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>Well done Yellow for being the overall winners and thank you to Miss Higgins for organizing the event! A big,
        big, “Thank you” to the bakers, helpers and supporters of our Tea at Three last Friday.  We made £214.00 for the
        pot! WOW</p>
	
        <h2>Football</h2>

        <p>Players of the week were: <strong>Ollie Wynn</strong> and <strong>Jack Field</strong> – well done!</p>

        <p>Thank you to all of the children who were so passionate and well behaved in their support of the England team
        on Wednesday!  Thank you to the Mums who came to cook sausages and served squash at half time. Thank you lastly
        to the staff that stayed with the children on such a beautifully sunny afternoon. </p>
