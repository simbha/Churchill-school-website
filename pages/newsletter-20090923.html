        <h1>Newsletter - 23rd September 2009</h1>

        <p>This week we celebrated World Peace Day and the children thought of ways they could make their lives and the
        lives of others more peaceful.  Thank you Mrs Williams and Ms Joskey for teaching the children the peace
        song:</p>
        
        <blockquote><p>No war will stop us singing ……<br/>
        We are the future<br/>
        We are tomorrow<br/>
        We are the peace that you all crave …….</p></blockquote>

        <p>Children will be singing the full version of the song at KS2 Harvest Festival.</p>

        <h2>Quiz and Curry Night</h2>

        <p>Come along this Saturday and enjoy our PTA Quiz and Curry Night – tickets are £5.00 each.  A bar will be
        available.</p>

        <h2>Playground Reminder</h2>

        <p>Please remember that before 8.45 a.m. and after 3.30 p.m. our school playground is not supervised.  May we
        also remind parents that children should not play on the playground equipment or cycle/scooter around the
        playground for their own safety and the safety of others.</p>

        <h2 id="agm">PTA A.G.M.</h2>

        <p>Members of the PTA Committee work very hard to raise funds and organise social events for adults and children
        throughout the year.  Come and join us on October 13th at 8 p.m. and learn more about their work and maybe
        consider joining the Committee next year.</p>

        <h2>Healthy Snacks</h2>

        <p>Please encourage your children to bring healthy break time snacks.  Fruit is available for KS1 children and
        many children in KS2 now bring fruit.  We will be doing a “break survey” soon and will let you know the
        results.</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>

        <p>Well done to:  Charles Lovell and Ben Wheeler, who were players of the week.</p>

        <h2 id="cowboylunch">Cowboy Lunch</h2>

        <p>On Thursday October 15th there will be a change to the menu for school meals.  The cowboy lunch will be:
        sausages, pasta, baked beans – mixed together and ice cream and cookies for dessert.  Look out for the
        posters!</p>



        <h2 id="harvest">Harvest Lunch/Events</h2>

        help. Money raised will go towards Children’s Hospice South West and supporting Woodford Primary School in South

        copy, please ask your child’s class teacher.  A huge “thank you” to all of the people who keep our website
