        <h1>Newsletter - 25th April 2012</h1>

        <h2>Mrs. Williams</h2>

        <p>After ‘many years’ at Churchill Primary School <strong>Mrs. Williams</strong> will be
        retiring at the end of this year. She has organised maths, geography, history and music
        during her time with us. Her classes have benefitted from her further teaching and many
        interests especially in promoting care of our environment. We will be dedicating a T@3 to her
        later in the year. </p>

        <p>Yesterday we interviewed and appointed a new <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> teacher,
        <strong>Ms. Gabrielle Barnes</strong>, who will join us in September</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week is about speaking out. We will be encouraging children to talk
        about a variety of subjects.</p>

        <p>This Friday the assembly will be taken by <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> and NOT
        the <span class="yeargroup">Reception</span> class (parents are most welcome to join us at
        <strong>9.00am</strong> in the school hall).</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done to those who received certificates in assembly last term:-</p>

        <h2>St. George’s Day Parade</h2>

        <p><strong>Mark Taylor</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> wrote a report on
        St. George’s Day Parade. He said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“On <span class="yeargroup">Sunday the 22nd</span> a Scout, Beaver,
        Adventurer and Cub Parade was held for St. George’s day. Me and my brothers
        <strong>Jack</strong> and <strong>Kyle</strong> were there. <strong>Kyle</strong> carried
        his group’s flag. Half of the Axe district was there. We started at Weston beach, most of
        the time it was raining and we walked to a park with a band stand, we had 3 live bands. We
        sang 3 songs and the national anthem. About 20 awards were given out. We all had
        fun”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Easter Bonnet &amp; T@3 19th April</h2>

        <p>Thank you to the parents and children who enjoyed T@3 with us. We raised
        <strong>£50</strong> which will be used to buy science equipment. The hat winners were –
        <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> <strong>Mary Hemmings</strong> and <span
        class="yeargroup">KS2</span> <strong>Jack Panicucci</strong> and <strong>Mia
        Wakeling</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Questionnaires</h2>

        <p>Thank you to the 23 families who returned the questionnaires. We have grouped together
        the comments where you feel we “could do better” and will share our plans to put these
        improvements in place over the coming weeks. Each week we will share the things you like
        about our school so this week…</p>

        <h2>…Could Do Better</h2>

        <p>More role models. We currently employ <strong>Paul Mason</strong>, Churchill Academy PE
        teacher who is a male role model, in all of our classes.</p>

        <p>This week we interviewed candidates for our <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> teaching
        vacancy – the best teacher was female.</p>

        <h2>What you like about our school</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>It is very welcoming to parents.</li>
          <li>Older children play quite happily with younger children.</li>
          <li>Wide variety of special assemblies to improve understanding of world/beliefs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The zoo came to us!</h2>

        <p>A huge thank you to our very special ‘family’ who this morning covered all of the costs
        for each class to have time with the zoo education teachers and animals. More exciting
        details next week. Watch out for the article in the Mercury next week.</p>

        <h2>Choir</h2>

        <p><strong>Charlotte Wilkinson</strong> and <strong>Lizzie Woodland</strong> in <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“On <strong>Monday, 23rd April</strong> the school choir went to the Old
        Vicarage Home to sing to the elderly. We sang ‘All in an Easter Garden’, ‘Carpenter,
        Carpenter’ and ‘Colours of Day’. We had a really good time”.</p></blockquote>


        <h2>A children’s view of lunchtimes</h2>

        <p><strong>Oli</strong> and <strong>Jemma</strong> from <span class="yeargroup">Year
        4</span> commented that they liked the fact that no-one is fighting anymore. They also
        suggested that they would like more games to play in the playground.</p>

        <h2>PTA Band in the Barn</h2>

        <p>Tickets are now on sale for the PTA event ‘Band in the Barn’ on <strong>Friday, 25th
        May</strong> from your class rep, PTA or school office. Tickets are <strong>£10</strong> to
        include BBQ. This promises to be a really good night. Please support this event.</p>

        <h2>Music Lessons</h2>

        <p>If you child has music lessons and is absent from school on that day please could you
        inform the music service on <strong>01934 426430</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Children who are sick</h2>

        <p>Please remember that if your child has been sick they should not return to school
        until 48 hours after the last bout.</p>

        <h2>Oops… Library Opening Times</h2>

        <p>The Library opening time for <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> is on a
        <strong>Monday</strong> and not Tuesday as given in last week’s newsletter.</p>

        <h2>Parking</h2>

        <p>We have noticed that the parking has become an issue outside school. Please do not
        ‘double park’ as this not only causes an obstruction to the flow of traffic but is also
        hazardous for children alighting from cars.</p>
