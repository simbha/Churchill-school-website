        <h1>PTA Newsletter - 19th November 2009</h1>

        <h2>Christmas Fayre Update</h2>

        <p>The Christmas Fayre is fast approaching and we thought a reminder list of what's needed when might be
        helpful;</p>
        
        <h3 id="hamper">Tomorrow</h3>

        <p>Could hamper items be in by tomorrow (Friday 20th) please. Each class has a box for hamper items.</p>

        <h3 id="mufti">Next Friday (27th November) Mufti Day</h3>
        
        <p>Tombola items - There will be a mufti day in exchange for tombola items on Friday 27th November. This year in
        addition to our normal tombola we will be running a children's tombola stall. Could you bring an item for either
        (or both). A suggestion for the children's tombola stall is to decorate a glass jar (jam jar size) containing a
        small toy, marbles etc. Mrs Strawbridge will be showing the children some examples this week.</p>

        <h3>Books &amp; Toys</h3>

        <p>If you have any good quality books or toys for the fayre could you bring them in to school in the week
        leading up to the fayre.</p>

        <h3 id="cakes">Friday 4th December</h3>

        <p>Cakes for the cake stall please.</p>

        <h2>Stalls at Xmas Fayre</h2>

        <p>We have a variety of stall holders attending the fayre but we've still room for a few more so if you know of
        someone who may be interested in having a stall please contact Katy Pearce on 01934 853094.</p>

        <h2>Stall Rota</h2>

        <p>I'm sure you will have been approached by a PTA class rep asking if you could spare just half an hour to help
        at the fayre. We really can't run the stalls without your help and if everyone offers a little time then it's
        not an onerous task. Please try and help if you can.</p>

        <h2 id="promise">Promise Auction</h2>

        <p>Promises to be in by Monday 23rd November (next Monday).  At our Xmas fayre we will be holding another
        promise auction. Over the past few years the promise auction has been highly successful but it does rely upon
        everyone's help. if you know of any companies or organisations that might donate something for the auction the
        could you please contact a member of the PTA or speak with Mrs Joskey (year 6). We will also be looking for the
        sort of promises that we can all help out with for example; a evening babysitting, baking a cake for special
        occasion; a few hours gardening - virtually anything goes so please help us out with an item or two for the
        promise auction it will be much appreciated.</p>

        <h2>Other</h2>

        <p>The school has a number of educational videos that they would like to transfer to DVD format if anyone has a
        piece of equipment that they would be happy to loan to school for a short while would you please contact the
        school office. Many thanks.</p>

        <p>We appreciate there is a lot going on over the coming weeks but we really do need your help to ensure that
        the Christmas Fayre is a success. We very much appreciate your support. Thank you.</p>
