        <h1>Newsletter - 12th January 2011</h1>

	<p>Last week we were thinking about ear muffs and scarves - this week we need umbrellas and
	wellies. Children have settled back well into the school and have enjoyed sharing their New
	Year Resolutions. Do come and look at our resolution tree in the entrance hall when you are
	passing.</p>

	<h2>PTA</h2>

	<p>Our outstanding PTA invite you to a Quiz Night on <strong>January 29th</strong>. The
	licence has been booked, questions listed and food organised. See your child's class PTA
	representative or the school office for tickets.</p>

	<h2>News from Woodford Primary</h2>

	<p><strong>Erin</strong>, <strong>Sophie</strong>, <strong>Finley</strong> and
	<strong>Amelia</strong> have shared the information sent from Woodford pupils and made an
	informative display. Ask your children what they've found out and what surprised them!</p>

	<h2>Epiphany</h2>

	<p>Epiphany was celebrated in great style, <strong>Ms Shroder</strong> and <strong>Mrs
	Strawbridge</strong> prepared beautiful cakes and we all learnt about <strong>January
	6th</strong> celebrations around the world, from Mexico to Slovenia and countries
	between. <strong>Mademoiselle Coulon</strong> taught each class about the French
	traditions. <strong>Oliver</strong>, <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span>,

	a special lunch in the office.</p>

	<h2>Big Breakfast</h2>

	<p>All welcome to join us for breakfast on <strong>January 24th</strong> and be part of
	National Breakfast Day. <strong>Urgently seeking</strong> helpers to cook toast, pour juice,
	make porridge and enjoy! Please come and see me if you can help.</p>

	<h2>Coming and going</h2>

	<p>Coming in the morning:- Please remember inside the school building is not supervised so
	children in <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> should only come in if they have an
	instrument to drop off. This gives staff the opportunity to meet with parents in their
	classrooms.</p>

	<p>&#x2026; and going:- Our playground is not supervised after school so children should not
	be using equipment.</p>
