        <h2>Harvest</h2>

        <p>The children have harvested the vegetables from the school garden – well done kitchen
        club and <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>. These will be peeled, chopped and cleaned by
        the children today and <strong>Miss Schroeder</strong> will be cooking up the stew while we
        are at Church tomorrow. Please encourage your children to bring in produce for the
        Children’s Hospice in Wraxall on <strong>Thursday morning</strong>. Looking forward to a
        busy Harvest Day. We all have so much to be thankful for.</p>

        <h2>The Governors</h2>

        <p>The Governing Body works hard to support staff and pupils in making our school a great
        place to learn, work and play. So that you may get to know your Governors better we are
        going to feature each one in the newsletter over the next few weeks. </p>

        <p>This week is <strong>Sally Furniss</strong> Chair of the Governors and LEA Governor: </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I have served as a Governor here for over 20 years.</p>

          <p>My own boys were educated here right through from Reception to 6th Form at the
          Community School. One is a doctor and the other an accountant and I am sure that their
          success has been built on the foundations of their time at Churchill Primary.</p>

          <p>I am currently serving as Chair of the Governing Body, and am part of the Management
          Committee. I also have special interest in the teaching of maths.</p>

          <p>My interest in science, food and nutrition led me to choose Dietetics as a
          profession. I work at Weston General Hospital, where I manage a team of ten Dieticians,
          and in my spare time love gardening, running and all my menagerie of animals.</p>

          <p>Why am I a Governor? Because of the children and because it is a wonderful school. I
          hope I can play a small part in its successful future development.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Lost</h2>

        <p>If anyone finds or has found a bright yellow USB stick in the form of a bracelet please
        could you bring it to the office. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>After school clubs</h2>

        <p>A big thank you to the teachers for organising and running after school clubs. These will
        start on <strong>Monday, 3rd October</strong> and finish on <strong>2nd
        December</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Walk to school</h2>

        <p>This will take place on <strong>Wednesday, 12th October 2011</strong> more details next
        week.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>A huge thank you to all <span class="yeargroup">year 1</span> parents who made cakes,
        helped serve and especially the washer uppers! We raised <strong>£142</strong>. I am sure
        <strong>Emily Grist</strong>’s grandparents thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent amaretto cake
        kindly made by <strong>Mrs. Holmes</strong>. This was raffled during the afternoon and
        certainly boosted the funds. Thank you <strong>Mrs. Holmes</strong>.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> residential trip</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> had a fantastic time on their trip to Knapp House
        last week. They particularly enjoyed surfing and visiting the destination for the new
        Pirates of the Caribbean film at full speed on the rib boat. They all had a great time
        working together as a team and having a go at some exciting activities for the first
        time.</p>

        see <strong>Mrs. Baber</strong> in the office.</p>
