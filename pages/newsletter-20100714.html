        <h2>PTA Summer Fair is Huge Success</h2>

        <p>Thank you to everyone who came and enjoyed the summer fair, we raised around <strong>£2,000</strong>, a
        fantastic achievement. A special thank you to all the adults and children who helped to set up on Friday night
        and take down on Sunday. I have great admiration for the PTA Committee, they spent many hours planning and
        preparing before the fair. Their hard work and dedication underpinned the event and ensured an amazing day for
        our village community – thank you to each of them.</p>

        <h2>Note from your Governors</h2>

        <p>This year we have welcomed on to the governing body <strong>Nick Hobson</strong>, <strong>Lorna
        Vickery</strong>, <strong>Corinne Higgins</strong> and, very recently, <strong>Ben Cuckson</strong> and have
        said farewell to <strong>Wyc Slingsby</strong>, <strong>Lynne Lloyd</strong>, <strong>Leigh Machell</strong>,
        <strong>Mary Smallwood</strong>, <strong>Roger Humm</strong>, and <strong>Jonathan Clamp</strong>. We are
        grateful to them all, wish them well, and warn all parents that we are always on the look-out for new governors
        to join us!</p>

        <p>The committees have been working hard as usual. The mammoth task of managing the finances and staffing
        requirements of the school is in the capable hands of the Management Committee. This year has seen the
        recruitment of four new class teachers, one part-time deputy head teacher, a bursar and an office administrator,
        so the Personnel Committee has also been kept very busy. The Facilities Committee have been masterminding the
        project to improve the playground and field area, and we are very excited that some of the work will be taking
        place over the summer holidays. Watch that space! In the meantime the Curriculum Committee have been
        familiarising themselves with the new Safeguarding regulations which have been introduced to protect our
        children as well as taking an active role in assessing the provision of the various curriculum subjects within
        our school.</p>

        <p>The every day business of reviewing policies, attending governors’ meetings and supporting all the school’s
        activities goes on behind the scenes. Please contact any of us if you have any concerns or an interest in making
        a further contribution to this great school.</p>

        <h2>Picnic</h2>

        <p>Thank you to all those parents who joined us for our “Teddy Bead Picnic” on Monday.  The weather was
        brilliant to us and everyone enjoyed the occasion!</p>

        <h2 id="backwell">Activities at Backwell Community School</h2>

        <p>The AGM will be held on <strong>Wednesday 22nd September</strong>. At this meeting the Chairman and Secretary
        will be standing down. Without a committee the after school club will not be able to operate so please think
        about taking on these roles. If you would like further details of what is involved please contact <strong>Louisa
