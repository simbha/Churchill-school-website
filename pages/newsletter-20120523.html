        <h1>Newsletter - 23rd May 2012</h1>

        <p>This term is flying by and we are all looking forward to <strong>31st May</strong>

        by then and we can share our tea in the playground.</p>

        <p>Thank you to the <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> team of adults and children for
        sharing their term’s work with us, the stories, poems and prayers were of a high standard. I

        <p>Well done to everyone who braved some of the inclement weather last week. The results of
        each class are as follows:</p>

        <h2>School Jubilee Street Party — 31st May</h2>

        <p>Details to follow separately.</p>

        <h2>The Sun Has Got His Hat On…</h2>

        <p>Now the sun is shining at last please could you send your child in with a sun hat and
        apply sun screen BEFORE coming to school.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> Certificate Of Registration</h2>

        <p>We have been inspected by the Soil Association’s Food for Life Catering Mark which means
        that the children having school dinners are getting a healthy meal. </p>

        <h2>Residential Thoughts – Folly Farm</h2>

        <p><strong>Kylan</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“I can’t wait for Folly Farm. I’m looking forward to doing all sorts of
        different activities. I think Folly Farm is a great idea because children will be
        enthusiastic for lessons and will get to know their classmates better”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Olympic Round Up</h2>

        <p>Thank you for helping your children make their Olympic torches. We will update you on
        next week’s letter about our walk around the village with our own Olympic torches. Thank you
        to the parents and governors who were able to be with us. </p>

        <h2>Village Jubilee — 3rd June</h2>

        <p>Children have been practising their singing and dancing, and we look forward to lots of
        families coming along to join the event. Worship at <strong>11.00am</strong> with the
        opening ceremony at <strong>12.00 noon</strong>. Our PTA are in charge of the BBQ so we can
        look forward to some succulent sausages/burgers with a pig roast in the early evening. Watch
        out for adult dancers who have been hard at work perfecting their steps. </p>

        the bus – please note the bus is so old that it does not have seat belts.</p>

        <p>So get your fancy red, white and blue clothes ready, join the Jubilee Spirit and spend
        the day enjoying the company of friends and family. Improvise on the inflatables, shop

        disco with DJ Ed at <strong>5.30pm</strong>. Make this a day to remember.</p>

        stall please let me know.</p>


        <h2>Fox Hunting — <span class="yeargroup">Y5</span></h2>

        <p>Emily Hurst has written:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“In <span class="yeargroup">class 5</span> we have been debating about fox
        hunting. Lots were for it but a good number were against. There were six groups which were
        local farmers, local residents, Fox Hound kennel owners, wildlife companions, local fox
        hunters and RSPCA representatives. We had four people come in and we told our arguments to
        them. They judged us and then they said that the local farmers were the
        best”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Netball </h2>

        <p>In netball club, the children have had the opportunity to improve their ball skills and
        to compete in games together and with other schools. All of the children have really
        improved over the year. We are looking forward to playing some more games with other schools
        soon.</p>

        <h2>A Child’s View Of Lunchtime</h2>

        <p><strong>Benedict</strong>, <strong>Toby</strong> and <strong>Joe</strong> all in <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> said that they liked their role model badges which allows
        them to “go around the corner” for some time with their own friends. They also like going on
        the field. One thing they would like to do more of is eat their lunch outside.</p>

        <h2>Parent Questionnaires </h2>

        <h3>…Could Do Better</h3>

        <p>Lunchtime issues sometimes spill over into classroom…</p>

        <p>All of our lunchtime assistants (LAs) are trained to support children to settle
        disagreements. Under the new lunchtime arrangements we are trialling an extension of the
        LAs’ supervision time to ensure that any disagreement is fully resolved before individuals
        return to class.</p>

        <h2>What We Do Well</h2>

        <p>A quote from one of the questionnaires “We love everything! Thank you for all your hard
        work. Great staff. Atmosphere of positivity, creativity, care, organisation, ideas/events,
        thoughtfulness, opportunities. None of it should be taken for granted”.</p>

        <h2>Our Governors</h2>

        <p>We have an amazing team of Governors who work hard and support the school in so many
        ways. <strong>Tristan Wilson</strong> has been a parent governor for 4 years on the
        management committee helping to balance our budget. His term has now come to an end but he
        is happy to assist a new governor in this role for one more year until his daughter leaves
        the school. Under Government regulations we must advertise for a new Governor. The
        nomination forms are attached to this letter. If you have any questions please pop in and
        talk them over.</p>

        <h2>Having A Holiday</h2>

        <p>As far as possible can I please remind you that holidays should be taken during term
        breaks. The next holiday is <strong>Monday 4th</strong> to <strong>Friday 8th</strong>
        June. Thank you in advance.</p>
