	<h1>Newsletter - 24th November 2010</h1>

	<p>There certainly is a Christmas feel in the air, lots of angel and shepherd costumes adorn
	the classrooms and music is wafting from the hall. Please remember to return permission
	slips, send in dinner money and coats at this busy time of year.</p>

	<h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> &amp; <span class="yeargroup">Reception</span> Class</h2>

	<p>Part of their project work will be operating an internal mail system for Christmas cards
	this year. Please ensure all children's Christmas cards are put in the "post box" which will
	be placed in the entrance hall on <strong>6th December</strong>.</p>

	<h2> It's that time of year&hellip;</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Have you put your promise in for the auction?</li>
	  <li>Thought about a tombola donation?</li>
	  <li>Saved a space in your diary for <strong>Saturday 4th December</strong> to visit the
	  school Christmas Fair?</li>
	  <li>Brought in your hamper donation?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Thank you in advance for all your kind gifts and giving of time and energy.</p>


	<h2>Please can you help?</h2>

	<p>We have a problem with our carpet in the <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> entrance. If
	you work with floors or carpets could you pop into the office and give us some advice? Thank
	you.</p>

	<h2>Enjoy an early Christmas treat</h2>

	<p>Churchill Methodist Church will be producing "The Nativity Pageant" on <strong>Sunday

	details telephone <strong>852956</strong>, <strong>862306</strong> or
	<strong>8521164</strong> or just come along and join us.</p>

	<h2>Children's Disco</h2>

	<p>Thank you to the PTA for organising the event and to the staff who stayed to help run
	it.</p>

	<h2>The Pantomime</h2>

	<p>A reminder that the Pantomime is <strong>Friday, 3rd December</strong>. We need to make an early start so
	the school gates will be open at <strong>08:20</strong> registration is at <strong>08:30</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Pleasant Way to Relax</h2>

	<p>Stop shopping early and come and enjoy a short guitar concert presented by our children
	and North Somerset Music Department at <strong>15:00</strong> on <strong>9th
	December</strong> in the school hall.</p>

	<h2>Children in Need</h2>

	<p>A fantastic total of <strong>Â£260</strong> was raised! The children looked wonderful in
	all their spotty clothes. Everyone enjoyed a slice of Pudsey Bear cake made by
	<strong>Ms. Schroeder</strong> and decorated by <strong>Mrs. Strawbridge</strong>. Thank you
	for your generosity.</p>

	<h2>Really Really Important</h2>

	<p>There are several people who still haven't let us know if they will be continuing music
	lessons in the new year. This is organised through the Music Service and it needs to be
	booked this week. <em>Please let us know by Friday of this week</em>. So if you want lessons
	&hellip;</p>

	<h2>Exciting fact of the week</h2>

	<p>This weeks fact has been chosen by Mitchell Miell</p>

	<blockquote><p>"Mexico once had three different Presidents in the space of 24
	hours".</p></blockquote>

	<p>Wow!</p>

	<h2>Coat and Lost Items</h2>

	<p>We have been handed a very nice children's coat with a previous pupils name in. We
	believe it was left at the disco. If you think you have lost it please call into the
	office. We also have various bits and pieces of lost property including hair clips,
	umbrellas and even a dummy, again these are in the office so please come and have a
	look.</p>
