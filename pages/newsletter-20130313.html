        on the morning. Cakes will also be available to purchase on the <strong>Friday</strong> at

        <h2>Maths Challenge Day</h2>

        <p>Last <strong>Thursday</strong>, four children in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span>
        took part in a Maths Challenge Day at Churchill Academy. They did brilliantly – especially
        as they were up against children in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> from other schools
        and gained full marks in a very challenging ‘cross-number’ round. Well done to our
        mathematicians, Alexandra, Evelyn, Tia and Isobel.</p>

        <h2>Kinectic Science Theatre Company</h2>

        <p>The children enjoyed the science production of ‘Lady Cecily’s Sound Box’. They found out
        and shared lots of new scientific sound facts. A big thank you to the PTA who helped to fund
        this fabulous event.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> Steam Museum Trip</h2>

        <p>Last <strong>Thursday</strong> <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> went to Swindon
        Steam Museum dressed as evacuees from World War 2. Mark said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“I enjoyed the trip – my favourite part was going in the Public Air Raid
        Shelter because there were lots of interesting things to look at, much more than I
        expected. Overall, I had fun!”</p></blockquote>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> Music Festival</h2>

        <p>A lively music festival was held at Churchill Academy last week. <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> enjoyed singing with children from other schools in our
        cluster. Songs had the theme of ‘looking after our environment’ which is very appropriate as
        this will be our topic next term!</p>

        <h2>Teacher Led Clubs</h2>

        <p>There will be <em>no</em> teacher led clubs next week.</p>

        <h2>Lunchtimes</h2>

        <p>As quoted from our recent Ofsted report ‘Pupils are polite and friendly showing respect
        and kindness to each other, behaving considerately around school.’</p>

        <p>Lunchtime Assistants are linked to individual classes and give feedback to class teachers
        as to how playtimes have been, reporting on both the good and not so good elements. Very
        occasionally where the behaviour of individual children has been a concern a member of the
        Senior Leadership Team will investigate during the afternoon. These are recorded in a
        behaviour log (Black Book). Children are spoken to and their parents informed that evening
        to discuss further actions by a member of the Senior Leadership Team.</p>

        <h2>Holy Communion After School Club</h2>

        <p>Reverend Kate and some of the Open the Book team are offering an after school club for
        children aged around 7 to 11, to learn more about the meaning and practice of Holy
        Communion. Sessions will be interactive, fun and will help children learn more about this
        important aspect of church life and Christian faith. The school now hold termly Holy
        Communion service during Collective Worship. The aims of the club are to help children,
        their friends, staff and parents celebrate being part of the school alongside promoting our
        Christian ethos. The plan is for this course to run for 6 weeks and we would like to know
        which day of the week suits most people (not Thursday please!). Please let either
        <strong>Reverend Kate</strong>, <strong>Mrs Tighe</strong> or <strong>Mrs
        Hetherington</strong> know your choice of day for the Club. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Blagdon &amp; Wrington Fundraising Group</h2>
