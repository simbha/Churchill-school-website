	<p><strong>Hannah Vowles</strong> and <strong>Jessica Vemon</strong> from <span
	class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> organised the Red Nose round table to include a competition

	<h2 id="mayday">1st May Village May fair</h2>

	<p>Plans are progressing well for this exciting event. Our children will be dancing and
	singing at the event and we will be crowning a May King and Queen along with 7 attendants who
	will be leading the opening of the Fair. Please encourage your children to take part in this
	traditional village event. A lucky dip for the selection of the King, Queen and attendants
	will take place after the Easter holidays.</p>

	<h2>Pushchairs &amp; corridors</h2>

	<p>As the weather improves please can we ask parents to wait outside for their children as
	the mad 3.30pm rush of children leaving combined with pushchairs and adults is an accident
	waiting to happen. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

	<h2>Parents working party</h2>

	<p>Coffee and cake bite this week is.... Annual Reports to Parents:-</p>

	<blockquote><p>Staff are always reviewing their work at Churchill Primary to offer you the
	best education for your child. This year your child's report will be shorter and the time to
	talk to your child's teacher longer - 15 minutes. A feed back sheet will be given to you at
	the end of the meeting and the parent working party will collate the information and use
	this for next years reporting.</p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p>In July you will receive a written report showing your child's National
	Curriculum level. If you have any questions ask a member of the working party for more
	information.</p></blockquote>

	<h2>Mini tennis coaching</h2>

	<p>Blagdon Tennis Club will be starting mini tennis coaching on <strong>Saturday, 2nd
	April</strong> from <strong>10:30</strong>. For more information please contact the LTA
	coach <strong>Michael</strong> on <strong>07748 157229</strong>.</p>
