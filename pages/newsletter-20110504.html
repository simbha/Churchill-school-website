        <h1>Newsletter - 4th May 2011</h1>

<p>Children have thoroughly enjoyed the last few days with so many celebrations. The Easter egg hunt organised by the School Council was great fun and encouraged children to appreciate their local environment. 
The "Street Party" led by Queen Strawbridge was amazing with a variety of hats worn by children and adults. Jelly and ice-cream supplied by PTA. 
The disco on Thursday had a lovely atmosphere and children remembered to use the bins so the hall was very easy to clear up.
The village May Fair was very well attended and our King and Queen, Ben Evans and Alexandra Wilson plus their attendants Lily-Em, Stan Hemmings, Liam Collins, William Maitland-Round, Maddie Votaw and Erin McCoubrey, rode in the trailer decorated with May branches and boughs through the village. It was lovely to see so many parents and children at the May Fair taking part and watching the traditional activities from Morris Dancing to wheelbarrow racing. Our thanks go to the Village Fund Committee for organising the event and bringing so many sections of our village community together. Special thanks to the bands who played and Gary Sharps band who had everyone on their feet! Lastly the Maitland-Round family for their fantastic posters and anyone else who we have missed!</p>
