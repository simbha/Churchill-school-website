        <h1>Newsletter - 5th September 2012</h1>

        <p>Welcome back to a busy autumn term. I hope everyone enjoyed their summer break and were
        inspired by the Olympics. I am certainly going to try harder to go the gym once a week. </p>

        <p>We will continue encouraging the children to enjoy sports through after school clubs and
        <strong>Mr. Mason</strong>, from Churchill Academy, teaching afternoons as well as our PE
        lessons including dance, swimming, gym and team games.</p>

        <p>The children have made a delightful start to the year and are full of enthusiasm for
        school.</p>

        <h2>Welcome</h2>

        <p><strong>Mrs. Williams</strong> would like to thank all the parents for their wonderful
        send off. <strong>Miss Mullins</strong> is our new <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>
        teacher and <strong>Mrs. McDermott</strong> and <strong>Mrs. McClean</strong> form the new
        classroom support team. <strong>Mrs. McClean</strong> will also be taking over three lunch
        duties each week. <strong>Miss Barnes</strong> is our new <span class="yeargroup">Year
        4</span> teacher with her support team, <strong>Mrs. Knapman</strong> and
        <strong>Mrs. McDermott</strong>. We also welcome <strong>Mrs. Smith</strong> to our
        Reception class.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr. Young</strong> has started as our new caretaker and has been very busy over
        the summer painting and fixing around the school. <strong>Ms. Schroeder</strong> has taken
        over the cleaning of <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> and has made the hall floor
        sparkle.</p>

        <p><strong>Mrs. Smith</strong> is our new gardener so watch out for her working party
        request in the near future!</p>

        <p>Welcome to all of them and we hope they enjoy working with our enthusiastic crew.</p>

        <p>We welcome all our “new families” and wish you a happy and successful time with us.</p>
