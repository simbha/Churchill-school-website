        <h2>Keeping your children safe</h2>

        <p>Within school children are encouraged to talk to adults about worries or fears. All staff
        have been given guidance on “Safe Working Practices”. Please remind your child of this.  A
        full copy of this document is available on the North Somerset website, soon to be linked on
        our school website.</p>

        whole school still managed to make, and eat, pancakes with a variety of additions including
        maple syrup, lemon, sugar and chocolate. A huge thank you to <strong>Miss Schroeder</strong>
        and <strong>Mrs. Churchill</strong> for all their help.</p>

        <h2>Governors Profile – Hayley West, Parent Governor</h2>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I was appointed as a parent governor in December 2011. I have two children at Churchill
        Primary and can be found most mornings and afternoons in the school playground.</p>

        <p>I have recently been asked to join the personnel committee. As a parent I have always
        tried to involve myself with school activities and hope to be more involved as a parent
        governor.</p>

        <p>I work part-time as a Paediatric Nursing Sister at the Bristol Royal Hospital for
        Children, I have had the pleasure of caring for children and their families for many years
        and hope to bring some of these experiences to the role of school governor.</p>

        <p>I enjoy many outdoor pursuits, gardening, reading and going to the gym.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>School Council Report</h2>

        <p>The school council have been working on a number of projects. They have been encouraging
        children not to play fight in the playground as this can lead to unpleasantness. They
        reported at the last meeting that there is now very little “play fighting” at
        lunchtimes. They have also been getting pupils to respect the toilets as you would any other
        room! Flushing every time after use, washing hands etc. Their next project is to organise
        pictures for the toilet walls.</p>
