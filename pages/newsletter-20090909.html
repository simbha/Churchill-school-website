        <h1>Newsletter - 9th September 2009</h1>      
        
        <p>Welcome back!  I hope that everyone enjoyed the summer break.  We have a busy term planned, 
starting with our Harvest Lunch on October 2nd and PTA Quiz and Curry Night on September 26th.  
We hope you will be able to join us for these special events.</p> 

        <h2>A Message from Miss Lewis</h2>
        <p>"I  would like to thank you for the gifts you gave me in July - in particular the garden furniture, 
which in spite of the weather we have had, has been much used and admired; but it was the things 
you said to me and the sentiments you expressed in writing which moved me the most and will stay 
with me always - thank you.  I have loved working with your children and I hope that I have given 
as much to them as they have given to me - there really is no better job!  Having said that, I am 
absolutely delighted to have retired!"  With my best wishes - Jane Lewis.</p>

        <h2 id="permissions">Permissions</h2>
        <p>If you do not want your child's work/photograph (un-named) to be used on the school website or in 
the local papers, please write and inform your child's class teacher by 14th September.  Thank you.</p>

       
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>If you have changed your telephone number of address or expect to do so at any time during the 
year, please let the school office know.  We will not be sending our "Data Collection Forms" this 
year.</p>

        <h2>Service Theme</h2>
        <p>This week, we have been talking about working as teams and next we will be looking at our place in 
the wider world.</p>

        <h2>Loos!</h2>
        <p>Could we please remind you that children should use the toilets in KS1 or KS2 - the disabled toilet 
can be used in "an emergency", but please note that the staff toilets are for staff only.  Thank you 
for your co-operation.</p>

<h2>A Plea for help with transport</h2>
<p>One of our parents who lives in Winscombe (Mrs Chambers) is in urgent need of help with 
transporting her son to school until the end of the Autumn Term.  If anyone is able to offer a lift to 
school, please telephone her on 01934 844991.</p>

   <h2 id="swimming">Swimming</h2>
<p>Swimming will start for Years 3 and 4 on Tuesday 15th September.  Please make sure your child 
brings their swimming trunks/costume and a towel.</p>    

   <h2>A Message from the PTA</h2>
<p>The PTA want to thank all the parents, friends and teachers of the school for helping us to organise 
the summer fair. We hope you all enjoyed the afternoon. We are still working out the final sum of 
money and will let you know how much we raised shortly.
 
Date for your diary - Quiz and curry night on Saturday 26 September at the school. Tickets will be 
available in school soon.
 
Lastly, thank you to everyone who has supported the PTA this year in anyway. This year we have 
provided a wide variety of items for the school including art easels, parasols, outdoor play tables, 
contribution towards the pantomime trip as well as giving each teacher an amount to spend on their 
class. Without your support we wouldn't be able to fund these. Please look out for the date of the 
AGM early in the Autumn term, we are always looking for new members.</p>     

   <h2>Dinner Money</h2>
<p>The cost of a school meal has been increased to &pound;1.95 per day (&pound;9.75 per week).  We would be 
grateful, if you wish to pay weekly, if this is sent in on  Monday morning in advance, in a named 
envelope, to your child's class teacher.  If you wish to pay for  Term 1 in advance (period ending 
23rd October), the amount required will be &pound;70.20.  Please make cheques payable to "North 
Somerset Council". It would help us greatly if your child only has one or two dinners per week, if 
you could pay in advance for Term 1.  All credits will be carried over to Term 2.</p>

   <h2>Winscombe RFC</h2>
<p>"Winscombe RFC has vacancies at all age groups, from Reception Year up.  The club is the largest 
Mini and Junior club in Somerset and meets every Sunday at Winscombe Rec, from 10am.  U8s and 
below play tag rugby, with velcro belts.  Boys and girls welcome!  Phone 01934 843511 or see
