        <h1>Newsletter - 5th December 2012</h1>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for this week is about getting ready for Christmas to include the journey and
        the birth.</p>

        <h2>Tree Day 2012</h2>

        <blockquote><p>‘Our forests are a gift from our ancestors which must be passed on to our
        children’.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Last Friday, all dressed in green with wellies and waterproofs, we headed to our local
        green to join <strong>Reverend Kate</strong> and the Chairman of North Somerset
        Council. Together we planted a selection of trees including Rowans, Larches and Oaks,
        reflecting the name of the streets surrounding our school. During the rest of the day we
        investigated our native trees and thought some more about the messages from our earlier
        service, led by <strong>Mrs. Johns</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Football Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done to <strong>James Witchell</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y5</span>) and
        <strong>Joachim Hullah</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y2</span>).</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> Production</h2>

        <p>Ralph the Reindeer has been a huge success. The children have looked and sounded
        fantastic. What a cracking way to start the Christmas festivities. A member of our open the
        book group who joined the dress rehearsal commented “How lovely, that has set me up for
        Christmas!” Let’s hope Rudolph’s cold is done and dusted now and he is ready and raring for
        the busy weeks ahead!</p>

        <h2>Walk To St. Mary’s Church</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> enjoyed a special visit to St. Mary’s Church last
        week to learn about the Christian Community as part of their RE curriculum. Reverend
        <strong>Kate Sax</strong> helped the children find out about Parish life and they ended the
        morning taking photographs and making notes about the beautiful stained glass windows in
        preparation for Christmas artwork.</p>

        <h2>Mufti Day</h2>

        <p><strong>Friday, 7th December</strong> is Mufti Day, and in exchange for an item for the
        tombola or cakes you don’t have to wear school uniform.</p>

        <p>A photo studio will be set up in the Reception class this Saturday at the Christmas Fayre
        for your festive family photo.</p>

        goals.  Well done boys!</p>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Years 5 and 6</span> had a great time at the Badminton Festival
