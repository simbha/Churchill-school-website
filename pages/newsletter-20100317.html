        <h1>Newsletter - 17th March 2010</h1>

        <p>This week we had a visit from Liz Tunnard the Senior Primary Adviser for North Somerset.  She was most
        impressed with the school, the children, the quality of teaching and learning and the Governors – so
        congratulations to the whole school community!</p>

        <h2>Please Remember…</h2>

        <p>All money that comes into school needs to be in a named envelope (old or new) or a purse.  Thank you.</p>

        <h2>A Plea From Our Dinner Ladies</h2>

        <p>We now have the sand pit open, but have a shortage of “toys”.  If you have anything suitable from spades to
        buckets to plastic animals, please send them into school.</p>

        <h2>The Village Fund</h2>

        <p>The Village Fund Committee are holding their AGM tonight (17th March) at 8 p.m. at The Langford Inn.  Please
        come along and join them for a glass of wine and give them your views. Over the last 20 years they have raised
        and distributed many thousands of pounds to a number of local causes.</p>

        <h2>In Case You Have Forgotten…</h2>

        <p>Children benefit from sharing their reading books with you every night.  For early readers, it may be
        discussion of pictures and for older readers discussing the chapter they have just read.</p>

        <h2 id="learning">Everyone Is Invited</h2>

        <p>Even if your child finds learning easy, you may be interested in joining parents on April 28th at 7.30
        p.m. at Churchill Primary School, to learn more about barriers to learning and how you can support your child in
        all areas of the curriculum.</p>

        <h2>News (good!)</h2>

        <p>We have had two African Snails donated to school.  Children are currently choosing their names – suggestions
        include Bo and Peep, Church and Hill.  If you have any suggestions please send them to the office by Friday of
        this week.</p>
