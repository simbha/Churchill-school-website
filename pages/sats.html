        <h2>On the Day</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Please ensure your child arrives promptly in school every morning - lateness cannot be accommodated. Any
          late children will complete tests away from the rest of the class.</li>
          <li>Tests will take place in classes 6, the library and studio.</li>
          <li>Numerous staff will be available.</li>
          <li>Discussion and warm-up before starting paper.</li>
          <li>Read through information in paper together.</li>
          <li>Children will be aware of time available.</li>
          <li>Some children will work with a reader.</li>
          <li>All children can have questions read to them in Maths papers.</li>
          <li>Children can look back over paper - will be encouraged to check their work.</li>
          <li>In case of illness - can stop and continue later.</li>
          <li>Cheating will not be tolerated - the QCA guidance states that papers in this instance will be removed from
          the children and they will score zero on the papers in question.</li>
          <li>We can scribe over handwriting as necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>After the Tests</h2>

        <h3>Results</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>School hopes to get results at beginning of July.</li>
          <li>Results need to be checked by school.</li>
          <li>We hope to share results by middle of July - you will receive a written summary for your child.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Secondary School</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Secondary schools will receive SAT scores and teacher assessments.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The children have worked incredibly hard over the past few terms and we are sure that when they take the
          tests they will be confident in their knowledge. They should all feel proud of the effort and enthusiasm they
          have put in.</p>

          <p>Finally, on behalf of the Year 6 team we would like to take this opportunity to wish you and your families a
          happy Easter.</p>
