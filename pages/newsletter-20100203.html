        <h1>Newsletter - 3rd February 2010</h1>
        
        <p>It seems the snow has now turned to rain, so please could I remind parents to make sure that their children
        have coats in school for playtimes.</p>

        <p>It has also been noticed that some parents are parking opposite the school on the grass verge in Pudding Pie
        Lane.  This is very dangerous as it means children have to cross the road in between parked cars outside of the
        school.  Please resist the temptation to do this – child safety is very important to us!</p>
