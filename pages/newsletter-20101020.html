        <h1>Newsletter - 20th October 2010</h1>


<p>This term seems to have flown by with many exciting events leading to lots of learning.</p>

<h2>Have A Look</h2>

<p>On the Mercury website if you wish to see photos that have been taken of pupils in school.
These are available for you to buy. The current <span class="yeargroup">reception class</span> photo will be published after half 
term in the Mercury.</p>

<h2>Apple Week</h2>

<p>This week we have been looking at different varieties of apples grown in our country and around 
the world. <strong>Miss Schroeder</strong> will be cooking apples for the whole school! Did you know the 
Romans brought apples to England?</p>
 
<h2>Very Well Done</h2>

<p><span class="yeargroup">Class 6</span> spent three days at Kilve Court experiencing outdoor activities and team building 
exercises. They came back tired but elated at their successful time.</p>

<h2>Enjoyment And Learning</h2>

<p>Staff spent two days working together to learn more about teaching children through a skills 
based curriculum. We were led by Tim and Maxine from North Somerset and the course was 
funded from the work that I completed at Sandford last year.</p>

<h2>Folly Farm Report</h2>

<p>Last Wednesday <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> went to Folly Farm. Oliver Wynn said "The best bit was making felt 
pictures because you get to hit it". Thank you to all the parents who supported T@3 as this 
helped towards the cost of the trip.</p>

<h2>Useful Information</h2>

<p>Governors met last week. They welcomed <strong>Karen Campbell</strong> to the governing body and she has 
joined the personnel sub committee. They discussed the School Improvement Plan (SIP) which 
has three key strands this year:-</p>

<ol>
<li>Creative Curriculum - Inspire children to be independent, innovative and reflective 
learners.</li>
<li>Assessment - Evidence of Assessment Data used to influencing planning and practice, 
enabling all children to succeed and reach their full potential.</li>
<li>Community and Church - to deepen links, relationships and communications with the 
Church and community.</li>
</ol>

<p>They also took reports from committees:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum had been looking at maths and marking in school.</li>
<li>Management had been working on balancing the budget.</li>
<li>Facilities had been working to complete the outside play area, planning and sun shelter.</li>
<li>Personnel have been looking at support new staff in post.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to the governing team for their work in our school.</p>
