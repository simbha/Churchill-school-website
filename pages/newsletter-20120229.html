        <h2>Congratulations</h2>

        <p><strong>Mr. Bush</strong> has completed a year of training and has now passed his QCF level
        2 in learning and teaching assistant qualification.</p>

        <h2>Dance your socks off</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> went to the Playhouse in Weston for “Dance Your
        Socks Off”. <strong>Hugo</strong>, <strong>Luca</strong> and <strong>Iris-May</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p> “It was fabulous. It was exciting on stage; we had wings. It was fun and it
        was the first time we went on a stage in front of 600 people”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>Very many thanks to all who attended the <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> T@3 on
        Friday; they made <strong>£108</strong>!</p>

        <h2>Mr. Anderson</h2>

        <p><strong>Mr. Anderson</strong> is resting and repairing his ankle for the next two weeks
        so <strong>Mr. Bush</strong> and <strong>Mr. Hosgood</strong> have taken over some of his
        duties. Please let us know if we overlook things—apologies for back gate not being opened
        on time—we will improve!</p>

        <p>While he is away our fish are swimming around in a rather murky soup—any volunteers to
        freshen their tank would be most welcome. Please come to the office.</p>

        <h2>ICT Mark</h2>

        <p>We were extremely proud to be awarded the ICT Mark in recognition of ICT skills. There
        are only 4 other primary schools in North Somerset (out of 61) who hold this prestigious
        award.</p>

        <h2>Lunchtimes</h2>

        <p>The children and lunchtime assistants have been working hard to ensure that lunchtimes
        are a time of calm and enjoyment. Our last OfSTED report said lunchtime behaviour compared
        to the national average was ‘good’ but we wanted it to be better than good so watch our next
        weeks newsletter for the Principal Primary Advisors report on our lunchtimes!</p>

        <h2>Reading &amp; writing national trends</h2>

        <p>National trends show a decline in children’s reading and writing skills. In school we
        work hard to create an environment where children are surrounded by ideas to encourage
        thinking and talking. You can help by reading regularly with your child and discussing
        stories, poems and news items. Sometimes children’s lives are so busy that children miss out
        on the simple things in life—learning days of week, names of fruit or vegetables etc. So maybe
        some ‘old fashioned’ time is needed; who’s up for a country walk this weekend?</p>

        <h2>Saddlers 4 You</h2>

        <p>This boot and shoe repairer on the High Street in Wells has very kindly donated a cup for
        our use after the handle and our Citizens cup parted company, so if you are ever in Wells
        and need your shoes repaired please pay them a visit.</p>

        <div id="egg">

        collected on <strong>Wednesday 28th March</strong> at these places. All other entrants can
