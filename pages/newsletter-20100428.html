        <h1>Newsletter - 28th April 2010</h1>

        <p>Spring is finally here and the children have enjoyed being able to use our beautiful field once again!</p>

        <h2>May Day</h2>

        <p>Nicholas Woodhouse and Elise Campbell have been chosen as May King and Queen and have requested that all
        children come to school in a “hat”, or bring a fancy basket, and wear normal school uniform on Friday.  Nicholas
        and Elise will be leading the dancing at 2.30 p.m. and we hope you will be able to join us.</p>

        <h2>Youth Speaks</h2>

        <p>We are very proud to announce that on 22nd April we went to the Kings of Wessex School to take part in the
        Youth Speaks District Final 2010.  We really enjoyed it. Georgina introduced our speech about why we should eat
        5 fruit and vegetables a day.  Jasper wittily spoke to the large audience about the subject.  Oliver summed up
        Jasper’s speech and told the audience he had “been converted”!  Six acts performed and after a long wait they
        announced the winners.  When they called our name (after the runners up) we were so shocked and excited.  We
        really couldn’t believe it.  Thank you Mrs Penfold and everybody else that supported us. </p>

        <p>Written by Jasper, Oliver and Georgina.</p>

        <h2>Parent Working Party</h2>

        <p>We will be meeting for the first time next week and one of our first tasks will be writing the feedback from
        the Parent Questionnaires.</p>

        <h2>Service</h2>

        <p>This week we have been considering the meaning of friendship.  Children are full of incredible ideas when
        discussing what makes a true friend.  Next week our theme will be “generosity”.</p>

        <h2>Craze of the Week</h2>

        <p>Our “Craze of the Week” returns this week with Mrs Churchill leading Hula-hooping skills!</p>

        <h2>Year 2</h2>

        <p>Class 2 are off to St Fagan’s this week and so will be reporting back to you next week on their
        adventures!</p>

        <h2>Fund-Raising</h2>

        <p>May 7th is National Day of “No Sox”.  This ties in with our “generosity” theme for Service.  We are thinking
        about children at Woodford Primary School in South Africa who have no “sox” to wear and we invite children to
        come to school with no socks but shoes/flip flops/trainers etc and to make a donation towards the children at
        Woodford Primary to enable them to buy socks as they go into their winter season.  Thank you in advance for your
        support.</p>

        <h2>National Teachers Day</h2>

        <p>National Teachers Day is May 4th and it is an opportunity for us all to thank the hard working teachers in
        our school.  Our dedicated team put in many hours behind the scenes, preparing lessons, marking and assessing
        children’s work.  They make our school a very special place to be, so to all of them “THANK YOU”.</p>

        <h2>Mrs Lockyer</h2>

        <p>This week we say “Goodbye” to Mrs Lockyer and thank her for all of her hard work in school.  She enjoyed her
        retirement party on Saturday night and impressed us with her excellent dancing skills! We wish her every
        happiness in the future.</p>

        <h2>Interesting Fact</h2>

        <p>Our interesting fact of the week has been chosen by Josiah Barker:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“Amazon tribes have an unusual way of dealing with Tarantulas.  They barbecue them and eat them.  Apparently,
        they taste like prawns.”</p></blockquote>
