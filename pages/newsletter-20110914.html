	<h1>Newsletter - 14th September 2011</h1>

	<p>We are thrilled to hear that our International Award application has passed the test! Our extensive work in school that covers cultures, traditions and lives around the world has been recognised by this special award as outstanding. Thank you to all the staff who have worked so hard to achieve this goal especially Mrs. Humm for her work with our modern foreign language student.</p>

<h2>Congratulations</h2>
<p>Mrs. Lloyd and Mrs. Grant completed the Bristol Half Marathon at the weekend. The training and commitment needed to finish the race is huge - so well done to both of them. I wonder if any other school in North Somerset have had their Senior leadership team, Chair of Governors and Chair of Curriculum Committee completing this event? What a team!</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>Peace Service - come and share this service with us on Wednesday, 21st at 9.10 (space is limited). The children will be joining in together in the peace song and thinking about how they can encourage a peaceful world.</p>
