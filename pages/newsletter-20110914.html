	<h1>Newsletter - 14th September 2011</h1>

	<p>We are thrilled to hear that our International Award application has passed the test! Our extensive work in school that covers cultures, traditions and lives around the world has been recognised by this special award as outstanding. Thank you to all the staff who have worked so hard to achieve this goal, especially <strong>Mrs. Humm</strong> for her work with our modern foreign language student.</p>

<h2>Congratulations</h2>
<p><strong>Mrs. Lloyd</strong> and <strong>Mrs. Grant</strong> completed the Bristol Half Marathon at the weekend. The training and commitment needed to finish the race is huge - so well done to both of them. I wonder if any other school in North Somerset have had their Senior leadership team, Chair of Governors and Chair of Curriculum Committee completing this event? What a team!</p>
