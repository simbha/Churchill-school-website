        and the bar was constantly busy. The teas and amazing cakes, served in <span

        with their fantastic variety of animals were a hit and I’m sure we will be inviting them
        back. Thank you for all your donations which helped to make the Fayre a success raising
        around <strong>£1500</strong>! Thank you also to those who stayed behind to clear up.</p>
