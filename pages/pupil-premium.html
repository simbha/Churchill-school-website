        <h1>Pupil Premium</h1>

        <p>This year we have received £8,400 funding to support pupils who fit into the “Pupil
        Premium” category.  We have decided to provide additional classroom support for these
        children to further enhance their learning. We have focused the funding on 4 classes adding
        an additional thirteen hours per week across the classes. The progress of these children
        will be monitored to ensure that the additional support is positively impacting on their
        learning.</p>
