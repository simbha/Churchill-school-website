        <h1>Newsletter - 20th January 2010</h1>

        <p>It looks as though we may have our first snow free week of the term and things are returning to 
normal.  Norman is back, the floors are dry and everyone is warm.  Now we just need to collect the 
rest of the grit off the playground!</p>

<h2>Pleased To Announce....</h2>

        <p>Mrs Baker will be joining Reception Class as their LSA on Tuesday and Friday until the end of the 
school year to replace Mrs Wright.  Miss  Lewis will be working with Class 6 to cover Mrs  Gould-
Coates' absence whilst she is on Jury Service.</p>

        <h2>Excellent Result</h2>

        <p>Between us we raised £375 towards the relief fund for Haiti.  This will be used to buy a variety of 
items e.g:</p>
<p> *	£20 buys 3 tarpaulins to make basic shelters</p>
<p> *	£40 buys 24 buckets for carrying water</p>
<p> *	£50 buys 3 hygiene kits</p>

        <h2>An Opportunity For You</h2>

        <p>If you don't have access to a computer or internet  at home and receive free school meals for your 
children or income support, you may be eligible for financial assistance towards a 
computer/internet.  Please see Mrs Keenan in the school office if you are interested.</p>

        <h2>Special Event This Week Was... . . . .</h2>

        <p>Mr Thatcher joined us to lead our Wassailing celebrations.  He explained the history of Wassailing 
and gave us lots of fascinating  information about apple growing and cider making.</p>  <p>Emily and 
Charles acted as King and Queen and volunteers put toast on the apple tree.  He gave each class 
apple juice to drink with the apple cake made by Miss Schroeder and Miss Churchill.</p>

<p>We all learnt lots and will all be eating red-skinned apples in the future!  Do look at the website 
after the weekend to find out more and see the photographs!</p>
