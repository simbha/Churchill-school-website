        <h1>Newsletter - Wednesday 12th October</h1>

        <h2>Even though it was wet&#x2026;</h2>

        <p>Thank you to all those who joined the walk to school this morning. A massive 66%
        walked. We do appreciate that it can be difficult to change morning routines, so please
        don't feel pressured into taking part - maybe next time.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The children enjoyed wise words from four of our community leaders this week and the key
        skills they thought were important in leaders were organisation, attention, listening and
        encouragement. Next week's theme is feelings and friendships.</p>

        <h2>Lovely lunchtimes</h2>

        <p>This week we had the Principle Advisor from North Somerset and her colleague from the
        Vulnerable Learners team looking at lunchtimes in school. They were both impressed with what
        they "saw and heard". Once we have written details of areas they think we can improve,
        we will share our plans with you.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done this week to:</p>

        <h2>Our PTA needs you</h2>

        <p>The AGM will be held on <strong>Wednesday, 19th October</strong> from
        <strong>19:30</strong> in the school hall. Please come along and hear about the amazing PTA
        accomplishments over the last year and future plans. We need new members as our "old
        committee" will be leaving us soon and this will be a good year to build on their
        expertise.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>A smile is a curve that sets everything straight</h2>

        <p>On Friday we combined National Smile Day with National Poetry Day and asked all members
        of the school community “What makes you smile?”. In each class children combined their ideas
        to create different forms of poetry. Come and look at these poems on display in the next few
        weeks; we hope they make you smile too.</p>

        <div id="photos">
        <h2>Unique photographs</h2>

        <p>This year we are pleased to offer a fantastic opportunity to capture your family on
        film. Our school photographer will be available in the hall on <strong>Monday, 17th
        October</strong> from <strong>08:15</strong> onwards to take a family shot of all your
        children, from toddlers to teenagers!  Following this all children will have individual
        portraits taken and portraits with brothers and sisters. These will be ready to buy in time
        for Christmas.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>Come along for T@3 with a difference this <strong>Friday 14th October</strong>. <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> will be hosting a hot dog stall in addition to the usual
        tea, coffee and cakes.</p>

        <h2>Volunteers in school</h2>

        <p>Do you have some special talent you could share with us? We already are very lucky in our
        garden helpers and wall painters but we are always on the lookout for other helping
        hands. Please drop in at the office if you would like to help or be part of our Parent
        Working Party.</p>

        <h2>Governors profile - Ben Cuckson - Foundation Governor</h2>

        <blockquote><p>"I joined the governing body in February 2010. With two children at Churchill
        Primary one of the reasons I became a governor was to play a more active role in what
        happens with their education and to support improvements to the children's education and
        their environment. I also have one child at Churchill Pre-School. I am a member of the
        facilities committee. Having studied Naval Architecture at Newcastle I now work for a ship
        safety organisation in the local area. In my spare time, I am a keen gardener, have recently
        taken up beekeeping and hope to get back into sailing, if time allows".</p></blockquote>

        <h2>More than one?</h2>

        <p>If you would like more than one copy of any of the letters sent out please could you
        complete the attached slip and return to the office. Thank you.</p>
