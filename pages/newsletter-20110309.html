	<h2>Lost property</h2>

	<p>We have several watches, umbrellas and gloves, also some hairbands and odd children’s
	jewellery in the office. If you think you may have lost something please come and have a
	look. We will be clearing out if no one comes to collect.</p>

	<h2>Netball</h2>

	<p>Congratulations to our netball team who won the cluster group and will be defending the
	area this Friday at Backwell School</p>

	<h2>Parents working party</h2>

	<p>Coffee bite, this week’s piece is smaller so you will only need one biscuit and a small
	mug full:</p>

	<blockquote><p>Your child may come home from school telling you they have had Mrs X working
	with them today. Twice a week <span class="yeargroup">Classes 1-6</span> are split into 2
	groups for Maths and English and work in different rooms. Groups are led by either the class
	teacher or the PPA teacher both of whom know your children well. This gives the teachers an
	opportunity to work more closely with the children and target individual needs more easily
	than in a class of 30. This way of working has been very beneficial for all children and is
	know as “Class split”</p></blockquote>

	<h2>And finally…</h2>

	<p>Sadly my running shoes will be hanging up for the next few weeks as I injured my foot
	during the Bath Half Marathon, but still managed to finish - it is amazing what adrenalin
	can do! It will mean I may not be in school every day but please call in at the office and a
	member of staff will pass on messages, I’m just at the end of the phone.</p>

	<p>My two deputies Mrs Lloyd and Mrs Grant are always available and happy to help so please
	contact them with any questions or queries that you may have.</p>
