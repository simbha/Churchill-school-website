   <h2>10 years celebration &amp; open day </h2>

   <p>Thank you to everyone who took part in our 10 year celebrations. We look forward to seeing the
   results of our ‘digging’ in the spring. It was lovely to see so many past staff and governors
   giving up their afternoon to share our celebrations.</p>

   <h2>Amphitheatre opening</h2>

   <p>We officially opened our <span class="yeargroup">KS 2</span> amphitheatre last Wednesday,
   coinciding with our 10 year celebration. Our amphitheatre looked fantastic full of excited,
   smiling children. We are now looking forward to the arrival of our traversing wall this
   Thursday!</p>

   <h2>Netball</h2>

   <p>On Monday our netball club played two fantastic matches against Blagdon School here at
   Churchill. After an evenly matched game and two great goals, <span class="yeargroup">Year
   6</span> lost <strong>4-2</strong>. <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> also had a great game
   and won <strong>3-1</strong>. Well done everyone!</p>

   <h2>Competition winners</h2>

   <p><strong>Ellen-Mai Spearing</strong>, <strong>Alexandra Barnes-Ferguson</strong> and
   <strong>Sophie-Marie Webb</strong> (all in <span class="yeargroup">year 5</span>) held a
   competition for the round table called “Guess the book”. The books were “The Lion, the Witch and
   the Wardrobe”, “Charlie and Lola” and “Mr. Gum”. As they had so many correct answers they decided
   that the fairest way to pick the winners was to put all the names in a hat; the winners were:
   <strong>Maisie Johns</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span>,
   <strong>Harry Fear</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> and <strong>Mrs. Guy
   (LSA)</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span>. Well done to everyone who took part.</p>

   <h2>School photographs</h2>

   <p>If you wish to purchase your child’s school photograph in time for Christmas please could you
   bring them into the office by <strong>Friday</strong> at the latest. Thank you</p>

   <h2>Governors profile – Lesley Hegarty LEA Governor</h2>

   <blockquote>
   <p>I was appointed as a Parent Governor in 2001 when my children, Helen and Patrick, were at the
   school. As Helen has now left Churchill Academy and Patrick is in Year 11 my role has transferred
   to that of Local Authority Governor. I still remain very committed to the school and in
   particular its role within the local community, and am the governor with a special interest in
   Literacy.</p>

   <p>During my time as governor I have been Chair of the Personnel Committee, Vice Chair of the
   Governing Body and am now Chair of the Curriculum Committee.</p>

   <p>I love all sports (especially tennis), sing in a gospel choir, am a member of the Churchill
   and Langford Village Fund Committee and enjoy the company of family and friends.</p>

   <p>I have a degree in Modern Languages, spent time in the Royal Navy, was a stockbroker in the
   City and am now a garden designer.</p>
