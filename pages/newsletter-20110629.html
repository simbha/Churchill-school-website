        <h1>Newsletter - 29th June 2011</h1>

	<h2>Assembly theme</h2>

	<p>The theme for next week is all about summer and our environment.</p>

	<h2>Industrial action</h2>

	<p>Due to industrial action on <strong>Thursday 30th June</strong> the school will be closed
	for the day.</p>

	<h2>Summer Fair update</h2>

	<p>A separate PTA newsletter went home this week with a run down of dates see newsletter for
	reminder. Hopefully everyone is selling their raffle tickets as there will be some great
	prizes. Don't forget we are collecting old crockery and will soon be requesting books and
	toys. Anyone who can help at the summer fair can sign up next week - charts will be outside
	classrooms.</p>

	<h2>Music lessons</h2>

	<p>The music lessons held on <strong>Thursday 30th June</strong>, the day of industrial
	action, will hopefully be rearranged.</p>

	<p>The guitar lessons on the <strong>30th June</strong> will now happen on the <strong>6th
	July</strong> and the last lesson will be <strong>Tuesday l9th July</strong>.</p>

	<h2>St. John the Baptist - Picnic</h2>

	<p>An excellent afternoon was had by all the children and it was wonderful that so many
	parents joined us. The children will be writing an entertaining report for next week's
	newsletter.</p>

	<h2>Certificates</h2>

	<p>These are the recent recipients of certificates, well done all of you:-</p>

	<h2>Fact of the week</h2>

	<p><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> are learning about the Great Fire of London and at
	Churchill Primary School in Victorian times the children learnt how to remember the dates of
	the fire by repeating the following ditty:</p>

	<blockquote><p>"In sixteen hundred and sixty six, London burned like rotten
	sticks".</p></blockquote>

	<h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>'s trip to the Big Pit</h2>

	<p><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> had a fantastic trip to the Big Pit in Wales. We
	learned how children as young as 6 worked to hold the doors open in the tunnels. If they
	dropped their candles they would have to sit in the pitch darkness by themselves. Sometimes
	rats crawled over their feet and ate their bread if it wasn't in a tin box. Ugh!</p>

	<p><em>By Daniel Long.</em></p>

	<h2>After school clubs</h2>

	<p>Most of the school led clubs will finish week beginning <strong>4th July</strong> except
	for the Kitchen/Garden club and Miss Mullins choir which will finish week beginning the
	<strong>11th July</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Parents evening</h2>

	teachers will remain the same as this year). The dates are as follows:</p>
