        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> Science Club</h2>

        <p>It is not too late if you are interested in the Science Club as there are a few places
        left. Please bring your completed form to the office by <strong>Friday
        morning</strong>. Thank you.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> Service at St. Mary’s</h2>

        <p>It was lovely to meet with <strong>Reverend Sax</strong> and share our end of term
        service. Also thank you to the parents who walked with us and enjoyed a hot cuppa after.</p>

        <h2>Netball Team</h2>

        <p>The <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> netball team played really well at the cluster
        netball tournament at Churchill Academy on Monday. They won one of their matches
        <strong>7-0</strong> and only lost by one goal to the team who won the whole
        tournament. Well done Year 6!</p>

        <p>There will be no netball club on <strong>Monday, 20th February</strong> (first Monday
        back) as <strong>Mrs. Rowtcliff</strong> is on a course. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>

        <h2>Year 4 Bristol Museum Trip</h2>

        <p>We enjoyed the trip to Bristol museum and art gallery last Wednesday. It was interesting
        being archaeologists and feeling the Egyptian objects in the workshop. We liked seeing the
        Egyptian mummies and couldn’t believe they were 2,500 years old! We had an extraordinary day
        learning lots of mind blowing facts.</p>

        <h2>Governors Profile – Mrs. Lloyd, Teacher Governor </h2>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I have been a teacher governor for over six years. As a Deputy Head and member of the
        teaching staff I am constantly part of school life and enjoy being involved in the decisions
        required for the school to run efficiently. I sit on the Curriculum committee as my teaching
        position within school has provided me with a sound knowledge and expertise of the
        curriculum. I have two grown up children who have both gone through university. My hobbies
        include sport and gardening—in particular, growing and then eating my own vegetables.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Puzzle Week </h2>

        <p>All classes participated in puzzle week and had fun looking at different types of puzzles
        in their maths lessons and on the round table.</p>

        your generosity.</p>

        <h2>Kitchen Club Bells</h2>

        <p>We were very so busy cooking bean sprouts in kitchen club this week that we didn’t
        realise how much steam was being produced; it set off the fire alarm! All the remaining
        staff and children had to complete an impromptu fire drill.</p>
