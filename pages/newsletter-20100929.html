        <h1>Newsletter - 29th September 2010</h1>

<p>This has been a delightful week with children enjoying learning about harvest in their own 
community and across the world. Children have picked blackberries, made apple cake and 
harvest loaf, gathered the vegetables from the school garden, prepared vegetables for harvest 
stew and learnt songs and poems. A truly special time of year.</p>

<h2>And Tomorrow</h2>
<p>If each child could bring a small donation of food, fresh, dried or tinned this would be greatly 
appreciated by the Chef and residence of Weston Hospice. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Harvest Service at St. Mary's - 9.45am Years R/1/2 and 11.00am Years 3/4/5/6. We need 
parents to walk to the church with us. Please arrive at school 1/4 hour before children are due to 
leave. Please ensure your child has a waterproof coat/jacket.</p>

<p>Harvest Lunch - 11.50am Years R/1/ and 6 plus siblings and 12.50pm Years 2/3/4 and 5 plus 
siblings. If you have booked to eat lunch with your children please join your youngest child's 
class for lunch: collect them from the playground before going to the hall.</p>

<h2>Listen To Aquinas</h2>
<p>Tomorrow Year 1 are hosting T@3 and the Aquinas music group will be playing for a short 
concert at 3.00pm, so please come early and enjoy their musical talents.</p>

<p>The Galeazzi concert  -  will be held on Saturday, 9th October at St. Mary's Church, an 
opportunity to enjoy a musical workshop with your children. Supported by Churchill Music!</p>

<h2>Well Done</h2>
