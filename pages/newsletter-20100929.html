        <h1>Newsletter - 29th September 2010</h1>

<p>This has been a delightful week with children enjoying learning about harvest in their own 
community and across the world. Children have picked blackberries, made apple cake and 
harvest loaf, gathered the vegetables from the school garden, prepared vegetables for harvest 
stew and learnt songs and poems. A truly special time of year.</p>

appreciated by the Chef and residence of Weston Hospice. Thank you in advance.</p>
