        <h1>Newsletter - 21st October 2009</h1>

        <p>As this very busy term draws to a close, I hope you will enjoy the half-term break with your 
children amongst the leaves:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How silently they tumble down<br/>
  And come to rest upon the ground<br/>
  To lay a carpet rich and rare,<br/>
  Beneath the trees without a care,<br/>
  Content to sleep, their work well done,<br/>
  Colours gleaming in the sun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe your family could write a "leafy" poem to bring back to school on November 2nd for our 
display.</p>
