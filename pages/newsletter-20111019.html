        <h2>PTA - AGM</h2>

        <p>Tonight (<strong>19th October</strong>) the PTA AGM is in the school hall at
        <strong>19:30</strong>. We are all members of the PTA so please support this marvellous
        institution by coming along and hearing about their accomplishments over the last year and
        future plans. We need new members as our "old committee" will be leaving us soon and this
        will be a good year to build on their expertise.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme when we come back after half term is all about our school and its history.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> T@3 Friday 14th October</h2>

        <p>Thank you to everyone who supported T@3 last week; the money raised was <strong>£153</strong>!</p>

        <h2>Folly farm</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> had a wonderful Celtic day at Folly Farm last
        week. Two Celts, Alana and Canny, taught us about making wattle and daub, hurdles to keep
        animals in and making felt and weaving. We ate our lunch around a Celtic fire and listened
        to a Celtic tale.</p>

        <h2>Celebrating 10 years</h2>

        <p>In celebration of our school having been open for 10 years we would like to invite you to
        join us on <strong>Wednesday, 2nd November</strong> from <strong>13:45</strong> for tree and
        bulb planting, a tour of the school and tea and cakes. We will also be having an open
        morning on <strong>Saturday 5th November, 09:45-12:30</strong>. We look forward to seeing
        you and as many new and old pupils as possible.</p>

        <h2>Lunchtime report</h2>

        <p>Report from <strong>Sue Ivermee</strong>, Senior Primary Advisor for North Somerset:</p>

        <blockquote><p>Pupils' behaviour is judged to be 'good' with outstanding features.</p>

        <p>There is a clear plan in place to promote 'respect', with an expectation that pupils
        behave because they want to, not because they are told to.</p>

        <p>Pupils are polite, welcoming and friendly. They relate well to one another. Pupils'
        attitudes are good; this is because of a range of successful strategies the school provides
        to engage learners.</p>

        <p>Relationships are positive and the children report that they enjoy school and feel
        safe. The children said they like their lovely teachers and that they really enjoy
        school!</p>

        <p>Pupils like the themed days and knew the next day was National Smile Day! A display in
        the entrance was stimulating and engaging asking the children and other members of the
        school community to capture what it is that makes them smile.</p>

        <p>At lunchtimes the pupils go into the dinner hall from the playground sensibly and
        quietly. Older pupils take responsibility for the younger children. They play well together
        and engage purposefully with the resources provided. The playground is zoned and harmonious
        with areas for games, quiet areas and active areas with climbing equipment.</p>

        <p>A positive approach to behaviour management is used throughout the school. The revised
        behaviour policy ensures routines are well established and expectations clear.</p>

        <p>Pupils value the weekly cups that are awarded and want to win them. These include the
        Citizen Cup, the Cloakroom Cup and the Lunchtime Assistant Cup. The Citizen Cup is coveted;
        one pupil said he was "working towards it and hoped to win it soon".</p></blockquote>

        <p>We believe that lunchtimes can be even better and to this end we will be planning some
        changes to our lunchtime organisation; details at the start of next term.</p>

        <h2>Village fund - Maypole</h2>

        <p>The Village Fund has kindly purchased a Maypole for us, used for all kinds of dancing and
        celebration throughout the year. Very many thanks to the Village Fund Committee.</p>

        <h2>Christmas competition</h2>

        <p>Churchill and Langford Parish Council are running a decorated Christmas card competition
        for children who attend the school, Churchill Pre-school or who live in the Parish. The card
        can be made using any material. It will be collected on <strong>Wednesday, 14th
        December</strong> from school so please put your finished card in a suitable sized envelope
        with your name, address and age on the outside and leave in the box outside the office. If
        your child attends preschool please take them there for collection. Churchill Post Office,
        will also be collecting. Prizes are for the best designs and these will be printed in The
        Tower.</p>

        <h2>Lost school uniform</h2>

        <p>One of our gymnasts has lost their school uniform at the Friday gymnastics club. Please
        could you check that your child did not scoop up anything that didn't belong to them. On
        <strong>Thursday</strong> all the lost property we have will be on display in the
        playground, including many coats. Please look to see if anything belongs to you. If we still
        have a bin full by the end of the Christmas term we will be sending it to the charity
        shop.</p>

        <h2>Shoe box appeal</h2>

        <p>These need to be returned to school by <strong>31st October</strong> (first day back
        after half term) for collection on <strong>Wednesday 2nd November</strong>.</p>
