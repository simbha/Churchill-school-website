<h2>Governors Profile - Claire Hosgood Non-teaching Staff Governor</h2>
<p>"I was appointed non-teaching staff governor in October 2005, but I have been working in school since 1999. I am currently the LSA based in Years 4 and 2, but I also have responsibility for children with speech and language difficulties. In this role I work closely with the Speech and Language Therapy department. I became a governor because I wanted to discover how the school worked at a management level.
I am currently on the facilities committee where I have the responsibility for Health and Safety. As a member of the school team I am constantly involved in the life and development of the school.
I have 2 children who both went to school here. Prior to having them I worked as a Junior Sister in a Forensic Psychiatric Unit, which involved planning the care of patients and the day to day management of the staff in the unit. Outside school my main interests are friends and family, cooking and reading".</p>

<h2>Children In Need</h2>
<p>Connie in Year 3 and Alexandra in Year 4 made cakes for this marvellous charity and raised £20! Alexandra, Jemma Charlotte W and Louise who ran the sweet shop raised an amazing £42 and the amount from Mufti Day was a massive £221. Well done everyone and thank you.</p>
