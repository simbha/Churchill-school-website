        <h1>Newsletter - 12th June 2013</h1>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>This week we have been listening to sounds around us and learning just how important it
        is to listen as well as talk. Next week we will be thinking about the future and how to deal
        with the unknown.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done to everyone who received certificates last week:</p>

        <h2>International Work</h2>

        <p>On Monday children spent the morning working in mixed age groups and visiting ‘6
        countries’. In Ireland they ate soda bread and learnt an Irish dance. In New Zealand they
        performed their own Haka and sampled Kiwi ice cream. In Africa they had the opportunity to
        learn some drumming skills and sampled fresh pineapple. In Spain they learnt some simple
        greetings and tasted paella. In India they watched a traditional wedding and learnt about
        mendi (Indian hand painting) while eating chapatti, and when they were in Cuba children
        enjoyed a traditional tale and ate black beans. Thank you to all the staff for their help
        with preparing 1,200 food samples for the children. It was an amazing experience for our
        children.</p>

        <h2>Indian Music</h2>

        <p>On Tuesday of this week <strong>Caro Barrett</strong>, from the North Somerset Music
        Service, joined us for the day and each class learnt either a rhythmical song or dance which
        they then performed to the whole school. Caro commented on the children’s outstanding
        listening skills and the way they worked together, well done everyone. Thank you to <strong>Miss
        Mullins</strong> for organising the day.</p>

        <h2>Cluster Swimming Gala</h2>

        <p><strong>Hatty</strong>, <strong>Frances</strong>, <strong>Oliver V</strong><strong>,
        Beatrice</strong>, <strong>Herbie</strong>, <strong>Samuel</strong>, <strong>Lexie</strong>,
        <strong>Sophie</strong>, <strong>Mary</strong>, <strong>Finely D</strong> and
        <strong>Rhianne</strong> all took part in the Cluster Swimming Gala on Tuesday 4th
        June. Congratulations to all as Churchill Primary came 2nd! Well done Wrington on your first
        place!</p>

        <h2>Mrs. Lloyd</h2>

        <p><strong>Mrs. Lloyd</strong> has been working at Churchill since 2000 and she has now
        decided, for personal reasons, to retire from full time teaching. We would like to thank her
        for all the work with children and staff. She has been a staff governor and Kid’s Club
        liaison representative as well as taking over the role of maths co-ordinator. She is always
        there at PTA events, children’s discos and the after school chess club has been popular. Her
        organisation and timetabling skills are legendary. She introduced many new elements to our
        curriculum including Folly Farm environmental studies. She will be missed by all of us and
        we wish her good luck for the future.</p>

        <h2>French Day – Tuesday 18th June</h2>
