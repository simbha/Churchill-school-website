        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <h2>Urgent</h2>

        <p>We have had notification by North Somerset Council of a red and black bracelet that is on
        sale made from the Jequirity bean, a deadly seed that contains the toxin abrin which if
        swallowed can kill. If you have one you need to return it to the place of purchase.</p>

        <h2>Brass Ensemble</h2>

        <p>We were joined by a number of cluster schools for a <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span>
        concert by “Metropolitan Brass” who also treated the whole school to a special show. The
        children learned fascinating facts about brass instruments through an interactive show.
        Highlights included hosepipe playing, the Simpsons and a new dance craze. Many thanks to
        Churchill Music! for sponsoring this.</p>

        <h2>Visit by the police</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> enjoyed a visit by <strong>PC Bradley</strong> and his
        colleagues on Monday. They shared information about their role as police officers and went
        outside to look at PC Bradley’s police car and how it worked. Did you hear the siren? Look
        out for their display outside <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> and <span
        class="yeargroup">Reception</span> classrooms.</p>

        <h2>Maths Challenge</h2>

        <p><strong>Lucy Slingsby</strong> and <span class="yeargroup">Jess Vernon</span> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y6</span>) said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“Last Thursday we went with <strong>Frances Wilson</strong> and <strong>Ben
        Corfield</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y5</span>) to Churchill Academy for a maths
        day. We really enjoyed the day and experience. We had to figure out some sequences which
        were really tricky. Also we did a relay race whilst handing out sheets with questions. We
        would like to thank <strong>Mrs. Penfold</strong> for taking us and the staff who organised
        this day as it wouldn’t have been possible without their help”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Easter Egg Competiton</h2>

        <p>We have received some entries to the Parish Council decorate an Easter egg
        competition. It is not too late to enter as the closing date is <strong>Wednesday, 28th

        <h2>Report from Sue Ivermee </h2>

        <p><strong>Sue Ivermee</strong> (Senior Primary Advisor for North Somerset and OFSTED
        Inspector) wrote the following report after her visit on 23rd February:-</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Lunchtime behaviour was observed. Pupils reported that ‘play fighting’ had stopped. Each
        class is working towards a whole school reward linked to lunchtime behaviour which will be a
        visit from Bristol Zoo. The lunchtime team were actively involving themselves in the outside
        activities. There now wear a very smart red jacket which means there are instantly
        visible. A recommendation made by the School Council.</p>

        <p>Pupils have a good awareness of different forms of bullying and take active steps to
        prevent it from occurring. They know the school will act swiftly to address any incidents of
        bullying that do occur. Pupils feel safe at school. Pupils are considerate, respectful and
        courteous to staff and each other. At lunchtimes pupils assess and manage risk appropriately
        to keep themselves safe. There are marked improvements in behaviour reported by the pupils
        at lunchtimes. Pupils observed take turns, share resources and cooperate well with each
        other. <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> pupils have been given additional
        responsibilities. They are now acting as ‘role models’. This has provided opportunities for
        them to undertake additional responsibility at lunchtimes. <span class="yeargroup">Year
        6</span> pupils act as role models for the younger children. They are very proud of their
        badges and recognise the clear expectations for this role and what happens if the forget to
        be a good ‘role model.’ Lunchtime Buddies are circulating more widely at lunchtimes if a
        need arises.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Sport Relief – Friday 23rd March</h2>

        <p>Calling all children! In aid of sport relief we are holding a non-uniform (mufti) day for
        a donation of coins. We are also having a special wake and shake for all to enjoy. The staff
        would also like to set you a challenge to see how close to a mile we can get by placing the
        coins we collect around the playground!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Scooter Service</h2>

        <p>We have a number of scooters in school that need general servicing and maybe some
        repairs. There is a small budget available for this if anyone out there is interested please
        see <strong>Mrs. Lloyd</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span>.</p>

        <h2>Soup Lunch</h2>

        <p>There will be a soup lunch in aid of Weston Hospice care on <strong>Friday, 16th
        March</strong> from <strong>11:30 – 14:30</strong>. This will be held in the Reading Room,
        Churchill (opposite the Methodist Church).</p>

        <h2>Running</h2>

        <p>Many people in our school community enjoy running and some of the governors thought it
        would be fun to organise a running event for the summer term for staff, governors and
        parents. We know that some keen runners are already signed up for the Bristol 10k and there
        may be other races coming up in the next few months. We would like to know if you would be
        interested in taking part in an event organised locally by the governors, possibly with a
        social event afterwards. If you are interested please would you fill in the slip below and
        return to the office. Thank you.</p>


        <h2>Reception meet &amp; say hello</h2>

        couple of get togethers. One is <strong>Friday, 16th March</strong> at “Emma’s House”
        straight from school. The other is <strong>Thursday 20th March</strong> at the Langford Inn
        for drinks in the evening. For more information please see <strong>Sheena Williams</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Cub Open Day</h2>

        <p>A Cub open day is being held at Sandford Scout Hut on <strong>Saturday, 31st March</strong> from <strong>13:00 to
        16:00</strong>.</p>

        <p>So any children between the ages of <span class="yeargroup">8 and 10 years</span> this is
        your chance to see what the Cub organisation is all about.</p>
