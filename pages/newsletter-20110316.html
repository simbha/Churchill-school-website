	<h1>Newsletter - 16th March 2011</h1>


	<h2>Assembly theme</h2>

	<p>The theme for next week is “Generations” including family trees, “Joseph’s Coat” and
	Noah’s Ark.</p>

	<h2>Apologies</h2>

	<p>We are very sorry we spelt <strong>Daniel Caulfield’s</strong> surname incorrectly last
	week</p>

	<h2 id="green">St. Patrick’s day</h2>

	<p>We hope all children will join our “green theme” on <strong>Thursday 17th March</strong>
	to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day. We ask children to wear school uniform but add on something
	green as a reminder of St. Patrick. We are hoping to sample some Irish soda bread. Thank you
	to <strong>Ms. Schroeder</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Fact of the week St. Patrick’s style</h2>

	<blockquote><p>"In Ireland on St. Patrick ’s Day people traditionally wear a small bunch of shamrocks
	on their jackets or caps. Children wear orange, white and green badges symbolising the
	Irish flag and females wear green ribbons in their hair."</p></blockquote>

	<p>by <strong>Kerry</strong>, <strong>Ella</strong>, <strong>Issy F</strong>, <strong>Melissa</strong> and
	<strong>Issy S</strong> all in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span>.</p>

	<h2>Round table</h2>

	<p><strong>Lucy</strong>, <strong>Ellie</strong> and <strong>Maddie</strong> decorated the
	round table with all things Irish an set up a Leprechaun hunt around school which children
	greatly enjoyed. Results of the hunt will be announced on Friday. Well done girls!</p>

	<h2>Certificates</h2>

	  <tr><th>Footballers</th><td>William &amp; David Clamp in <span class="yeargroup">Years

	</table>

	<h2>Red nose day</h2>

	<p>This has been organised by <strong>Hannah Vowles</strong> and <strong>Jessica
	Vernon</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span>.</p>

	<p>This <strong>Friday 18th March</strong> is Red Nose Day so we are having a mufti day, so
	for a <strong>50p</strong> donation for this very worthwhile cause wear something red. We
	will be having class quizzes and “Guess how many sweets are in the jar”. Take a look at the
	beautiful round table which Hannah and Jessica have designed.</p>

	<h2>Parking in Larch Close</h2>

	<p>Some of the residents in Larch Close have brought to our attention the bad parking around
	the entrance to Larch Close. Please be mindful that you do not obstruct this area and please
	make sure that the children do not walk on any of the gardens. </p>

	<p>According to the AA, children on foot are more likely to be killed in road accidents in
	Britain than in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany the Netherlands, Spain
	or Sweden.</p>

	<h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> trip to St. Fagans in Wales</h2>

	<p>This was a great day out with the weather staying dry. The children really enjoyed
	learning about houses from the past.</p>

	<h2>Music lessons</h2>

	<p>Bookings for music tuition for the summer term need to be made by <strong>Friday, 25th
	March</strong>. If you child is interested in starting music lessons please let the office
	know as soon as possible.</p>

	<h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> Blaise Castle museum trip</h2>

	<p><span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> and staff thoroughly enjoyed dressing up as
	Victorians. All the children were very well behaved and no one had to stand in the corning
	wearing a dunces hat! They were able to see some very old delicate toys and then investigate
	for themselves how old fashioned toys worked.</p>

	<h2>Netball</h2>

	<p>Last Friday our <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> netball team played in the High 5’s
	netball final. They played fantastically and won all their matches which led to a very tense
	final against Wrington who in the end beat them 3-2. However we have now qualified for the
	County finals on <strong>1st April</strong> – well done!</p>

	<h2>Parents working party</h2>

	<p>Coffee bite this week is…. Homework – Homework can cause conflict, some parents like to
	have it and others wish school gave them less. So… the policy says:-</p>

	<table>
	  <thead>
	    <tr><th>Year</th><th>Time/Week</th><th>Coverage</th></tr>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <tr><th class="yeargroup">R</th><td>1 Hour</td><td>Reading/phonic work as
	    appropriate.</td></tr>
	    <tr><th class="yeargroup">1 and 2</th><td>1 Hour</td><td>Reading/phonics and other
	    literacy work/numeracy. Occasional cross-curricular work.</td></tr>
	    <tr><th class="yeargroup">3 and 4</th><td>1 Hour 30 mins</td><td>Literacy and Numeracy,
	    occasional assignments in other subjects.</td></tr>
	    <tr><th class="yeargroup">5 and 6</th><td>2 Hours</td><td>Regular weekly schedule with
	    continued emphasis on literacy and Numeracy, but with a wide range of other curriculum
	    areas.</td></tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Teachers set and review homework to suit the age of the children they teach. If you have
	any questions please talk to your child’s class teacher for more information. Quick bites
	this week.</p>

	<h2>May fair</h2>

	<p>A May Fair is being organised by the Village Fund to take place on <strong>Sunday 1st
	May</strong> at the Recreation Ground (behind the doctor’s surgery). We wondered if there
	was anyone who would lend them a Karaoke machine to be used under adult supervision. Please
	contact the office.</p>

	<h2>Updated draft Relationships and Sex Education Policy </h2>

	<p>At the weekend please check the school website to read our Relationships and Sex
	Education policy and feed back any comments to the school office by <strong>1st
	April</strong>. Thank you.</p>
