        <h1>Newsletter - 24th March 2010</h1>

        <p>Finally, Spring seems to have sprung and daffodils, pansies and primroses planted so carefully many months
        ago are now glorious.  Do take a moment to look at the plants at the front door.</p>

        before the weekend begins!</p>

        <h2>Easter and the PTA</h2>

        <p>The PTA are organizing a fantastic Easter Extravaganza – baskets and bonnets and a Quiz on 30th March.  See
        the PTA green letter being sent home today for full fun details!</p>

        <p>Key Stage 2 will be going on a Easter Journey to discover the seven stations of the cross on Wednesday 31st

        <h2>Every Little Helps</h2>

        <p>If you have raised any sponsorship money for the NSPCC, please return it to school by tomorrow (Thursday
        25th).  All children took part in a “round the school walk” to remind them of the work of the NSPCC.</p>

        <h2>St Patrick</h2>

        <p>We celebrated St Patrick’s Day last week and <a
        href="http://www.apples4theteacher.com">www.apples4theteacher.com</a> has some lovely resources for you to use
        at home covering this and many other topics.</p>

        <h2>A Gentle Reminder</h2>

        <p>Last week we sent out a parent questionnaire with your child’s report.  Thank you to those who have
        completed and returned them and we look forward to many more by the end of the week!</p>

        <h2>Nice News</h2>

        <p>Mr Anderson is back – taking things gently at the moment, but well on the road to recovery.  A huge “thank
        you” to all of the people who helped whilst he was away.</p>

        <h2>Did You Know…</h2>

        <p>The fact of the week for this week was chosen by Oliver Wynn:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“Holland has the most bikes in the world.  One bike per person is the national average with an estimated 16
        million bicycles nationwide.  An average of 51 cars a year accidentally drive into the canals of Amsterdam”</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Wet and Windy!</h2>

        <p>The weather was not perfect, but Class R enjoyed their Teddy Bear’s Picnic this week.  They learnt about what
        people (and Teddy Bears!) need to survive.</p>

        <h2>In Service</h2>

        <p>Until the end of term, children will be studying the Easter Story and thinking about how they might make the
        lives of others easier.</p>

        <h2>Cress Growing</h2>

        <p>An incredible array of creations made using cress seeds graced our hall last week.  Class 4 were the overall
        winners for the most imaginative use of their seeds and Issy and Jacob were winners of the individual entries.
        See the Mercury this week for more information.</p>

        <h2>Hard Work Pays Off</h2>

        <p>Children from Years 3, 4, 5 and 6 played in a tag rugby tournament last week.  After only two sessions of
        training, pupils played well with the Years 3 and 4 team being runners up in their group.  Well done to all who
        helped and took part.</p>
