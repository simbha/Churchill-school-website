        <h1>Newsletter - 6th October 2010</h1>


<p>This week has seen some rather muddy playtimes so sadly the field will soon be out of use. 
Please ensure that your child has a coat in school each day so they can enjoy the cooler 
weather.</p>

friendly, fun, vibrant place to be for all of our children.</li>

<p>What an amazing day, the church services were uplifting - the children's enthusiasm was 
wonderful. The lunch was delicious and the gifts of food you donated numerous! The raffle at

promised to cook the marrows and garlic grown by the children with great care.</p>
