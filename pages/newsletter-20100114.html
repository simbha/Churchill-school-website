        <h1>Newsletter - 14th January 2010</h1> 
		
        <p>A huge thank you for the continued support you have given the school during the last two weeks.  Your
        patience and understanding when staff have not been able to get into school and all your help with snow clearing
        and salting, phone and website updating and much more.</p>

        <p>Governors, Grandads, parents, children, staff and friends have all played their part - a real community day
        effort!</p>

        <p>If you would like your child to take part in ICT Club or Choir, please complete the slip at the end of this
        letter and return on Friday January 15th to the school office.  Netball, Art (KS1), Conservation and Games clubs
        will keep the same pupils as last term. Children who took part in Kitchen Club last term have now finished this
        club and a new set of children have received their letters.  Miss Dyke's Multi-skills Club unfortunately will no
        longer run as we have no members of staff to run it - any volunteers?!</p>
