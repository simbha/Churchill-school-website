      <h1>School Meals</h1>

      <p>Our school has its own kitchen and meals are available under the arrangements made by North
      Somerset Council.  The charge for the term running from <strong>4th September 2012</strong> to
      <strong>25th October 2012</strong> is <strong>£76.00</strong>. This may either be paid in
      advance or paid weekly by bringing <strong>£10.00</strong> in a named envelope on Monday
      Mornings. Cheques should be made out to "North Somerset Council". Please contact the office to
      let us know of any alterations to a child’s normal pattern of meals.</p>

      <p>Children may have a school meal or bring a packed lunch. For those bringing packed lunch, we would ask that no
      pressurised cans of fizzy drink and no glass containers or bottles are included.</p>
