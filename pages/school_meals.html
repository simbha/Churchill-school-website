      <h1>School Meals</h1>

      <p>Our school has its own kitchen and meals are available under the arrangements made by North Somerset Council.
      The charge for the term running from 2nd November 2009 to 18th December 2009 is £68.25. This may either be paid in
      advance or paid weekly by bringing £9.75 in a named envelope on Monday Mornings. Cheques should be made out to
      "North Somerset Council". Please contact the office to let us know of any alterations to a child’s normal pattern
      of meals.</p>

      <p>Children may have a school meal or bring a packed lunch. For those bringing packed lunch, we would ask that no
      pressurised cans of fizzy drink and no glass containers or bottles are included.</p>
