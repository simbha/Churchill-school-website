        so that they can enjoy a coffee and a croissant!</p>

        <h2>Stranger Danger</h2>
        <p>Although we do not want to be alarmist, please raise awareness of "stranger danger" with your children.  It
        is always important to be vigilant; for example, recently in Backwell a middle-aged man in a white van was
        acting suspiciously.</p>

        <h2>Science Day</h2>
        <p>The school will be enjoying a special science day tomorrow with class workshops.  On Monday, Mrs Strawbridge
        has organised a spectacular Science Assembly run by the Mad Science Company.  We are hoping this will lead to a
        Science Club in September.  Look out for the Mad Science leaflets next week!</p>

        <h2>Eco Greenhouse</h2>
        <p>Thank you to all who have contributed plastic bottles to Class 1's Eco Greenhouse and to Mr Taylor who has
        helped in its construction.  We now have enough bottles!</p>

        <h2>Arts Week</h2>
        <p>To celebrate our Artsmark Gold award, over the next seven days we are having an Arts Week with a golden
        theme: "A pot of gold at the end of the rainbow".  Miss Ingram is leading dance workshops throughout the school
        and we are hoping our Dream Catchers, organised by Mrs Lockyer, will let the children's golden dreams pass
        through.  Ms Joskey has selected some fitting music and songs and we will be exploring how gold has inspired
        contemporary artists.  Thank you to Mr and Mrs Marlow and all the parents who have helped to make this such a
        success.</p>

        <p>Thank you also to Jasper Badger and Eleanor Wright for representing the school so magnificently on Monday at
        the Artsmark Award Ceremony in Cheltenham.</p>
