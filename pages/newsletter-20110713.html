	<p>The staff and governors of our school would like to say a big thank you to all the
	parents and outside volunteers that have helped during the past year. You make a huge
	difference to the work that we do in school.</p>

	<h2>LSA Change around</h2>

	<p>This year it is the turn of some of our Learning Support Assistants (LSA’s) ‘to move
	around’.</p>

	<table>
	  <tr><th class="yeargroup">Reception</th><td>Mrs. Baker/Ms. Woodfine</td></tr>
	  <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 1</th><td>Mrs. Holdaway</td></tr>
	  <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 2</th><td>Mrs. Guy</td></tr>
	  <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 3</th><td>Mrs. Beadle</td></tr>
	  <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 4</th><td>Mrs. Hosgood</td></tr>

	</table>

	<p>We have also employed a ‘floating’ LSA to work with our children on a one year trial, her
	name is <strong>Mrs. McDermott</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Open garden</h2>

	<p>On Tuesday afternoon the school garden was open to members of staff, school governors and
	parents of the children who participated in the gardening club. We all enjoyed tea and
	homemade scones and shortbread.  It was a very enjoyable evening.</p>

	<h2>Blankets for Woodford</h2>

	<p>Our volunteer, <strong>Mrs. Pain</strong>, has been teaching the children to knit. They
	have knitted squares which have been sewn together to make blankets to send to Woodford
	Primary, our linked school in South Africa as it is now their winter. The Community School
	have also donated their blankets to send. The project will continue next year so if you are
	interested or know some ‘knitters’ please join us in September.</p>

	<h2>Fact of the week</h2>

	<p><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> are rehearsing for their production so <strong>Euan
	Campbell</strong> and <strong>Toby Chambers</strong> found out that:</p>

	<blockquote><p>“Many believe that drama evolved out of the rituals and storytelling of
	ancient societies. In Greece, tragedy and comedy grew out of religious festivals honoring
	the God Dionysus”. </p></blockquote>

	<h2>Parents Evening</h2>

	<p>Just a reminder that the invitation for you to meet your child’s class teacher for
	September 2011 (class teachers will remain the same as this year) is as follows:- </p>
