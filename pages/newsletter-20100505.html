        <h1>Newsletter - 6th May 2010</h1>

        <p>I hope that you enjoyed your long weekend, the children certainly had fun from the North Somerset Show to
        picnics on the Mendips.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2> 

        <p>Mrs. Keenan, our School Bursar, has decided it is time to “hang up her calculator” so she can spend more time
        with her family. She is looking forward to long holidays in distant lands and enjoying watching her new
        granddaughter grow. She will finish work at the end of the summer term and will be greatly missed.</p>

        <h2>Helping Others – National ‘No Socks Day’</h2>

        <p>This Friday we have asked the children to come to school without wearing any socks for a donation
        e.g. wearing slippers, flip flops etc., which are comfortable with no socks. They need to wear the rest of their
        school uniform as usual. Any donations will be used to buy socks for children at Woodford School in South
        Africa, as their winter approaches.</p>

        <h2>In Year 1</h2>

        <p>To coincide with “No Socks Day”, children in Year 1 need an old white sock to use during their science
        lesson.</p>

        <h2>Little Reports</h2>

        <h3>Year 2 Trip to St. Fagans</h3>

        <p>St. Fagans is a museum showing homes from the past. We went into a Celtic Village and a row of cottages from
        1805 to 1985. Our best bit was when we went to a Victorian school where the teacher made you wash your hands and
        she checked them back and front and you had to sit up straight. They also only had two toys, one hoop with a
        stick, and the other was a ball on a string with a cup on the end and you swung the ball up and caught it in the
        cup. When it was cold the children carried a baked potato to school to keep their hands warm and when they
        reached school the teacher collected them in until lunch time.</p>

        <h3>Playtex Moonwalk</h3>

        <p>On Saturday 15th May Mrs. Holdaway in Year 1 and about 17,000 other women will be taking part in The Playtex
        Moonwalk in London all wearing decorated bras! After weeks of training the extraordinary moonlit 26.2 mile
        marathon is through the heart of London raising money for Breast Cancer. Anybody wanting to sponsor her or make
        a donation are more than welcome. Do pop in and see her.</p>

        <h2>Leaving Thankyous</h2>

        <p>Ms. Lockyer enjoyed her final send off on Friday with lovely cards from the children, a beautiful rose bush
        from parents and a fantastic cake made by Miss Schroeder. She has asked for her thanks to be passed to the
        school community.</p>

        <h2>Our Interesting Fact of the Week</h2>

        <h2>The Services Next Week</h2>

        <p>We will be celebrating Christian Aid next week and Mrs. Cook will join us on Tuesday to lead a special
        service for the children.</p>

        <h2>Picking Up</h2>

        <p>We seem to be getting a lot of calls at the end of the day when parents are unable to pick up their
        children. We would appreciate it if this could be done before the bell goes at 3.30pm as it is very difficult to
        find some children once they are out in the playground. We have had a few worrying moments where other parents
        have taken children home and we have not known! If you are taking a child who has been left in the playground
        please notify the office. Please remind your child that if they are not picked up they should go and wait in the
        library.</p>
