        <h1>Newsletter - 15th May 2013</h1>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>This week we have been celebrating Pentecost and <strong>Rev Kate Sax</strong> has joined
        us for worship.</p>

        <p>Next week we will be learning about different kinds of discovery including famous
        explorers who discovered new countries and the importance of medical discoveries.</p>

        <h2>Bristol Zoo Trip - <span class="yeargroup">YR</span></h2>

        <p>Thankfully the weather held off for our very enjoyable visit to the zoo last Thursday. We
        all had a wonderful time, with the highlights being seeing the lion cubs play-fighting and
        meeting the baby T-Rex!  The children also learned about conservation and were able to look
        closely at banned animal skins and goods that some people try to bring back to our country.
        It was sad to see. The children were impeccably behaved and polite, so much so, that a
        number of Zoo staff commented and thanked them!  Well done <span
        class="yeargroup">YR</span>!  A big thank you to the lovely mums who helped on the day.  It
        is much appreciated.</p>

        <h2>No Sox Day</h2>

        <p>Thank you for your kind contributions on No Sox Day - <strong>£63</strong> was raised. I
        have spoken to the head teacher at Woodford Primary School who will be using the money to
        buy long, grey socks for the most needy pupils. The pupils and parents at Woodford send
        their grateful thanks.</p>

        <h2>Walk To School</h2>

        <p>Despite the cold wind, the children enthusiastically took part in the walk to school day
        last week.</p>

        <p>Also, congratulations to <strong>Mrs Holdaway</strong> who last week completed the
        Bristol 10k run and walked 26 miles in the Moon Walk in London!</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>The Citizens Cup this week went to <strong>Oliver Vosper</strong>.  The children included
        in his talents “a friendly walking encyclopaedia of animals!” Watch out David
        Attenborough!</p>

        <p>Also congratulations to the following children who received the Head Teacher’s
        Certificate this week:</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">YR</th><td>Whole Class</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Y1</th><td>Max Clifton</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Y2</th><td>Erin-Jo Dwyer</td></tr>

        <p>Finally, congratulations to the guitarists who have achieved their Grade 1 certificates -
        <strong>George Brafield</strong>, <strong>Benjamin West</strong>, <strong>Vinny
        Giles</strong> and <strong>David Clamp</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Tea At Three</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> had a great trip to Cheddar on Tuesday and a report
        of their trip will follow next week.  We look forward to their T@3 on Friday. Please come
        and join us.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> Assembly</h2>

        <p>We are looking forward to learning about <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> activities
        when they present their assembly on <strong>Friday 17th May</strong> at
        <strong>9.10am</strong>.  Parents are welcome.</p>

        <h2>Spike Joins Our School!</h2>

        <p>A huge thank you to <strong>Mark</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> for
        organising the survey and subsequent vote for the name of our new bearded dragon. An
        ex-parent of CPS has provided funds for the bearded dragon and will continue to pay for his
        upkeep each month.  He is called Spike.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> End Of Term Service</h2>

        <p>This will take place at St. Mary’s Church in Langford on <strong>Tuesday, 21st
        May</strong> starting at <strong>2.30pm</strong>. All parents are welcome and if you would
        like to help walk the children to the church that would be lovely.</p>

        <h2>Chocolate Chips</h2>

        <p>Today we have been celebrating the humble chocolate chip by sharing cookies with the
        children.  The round table this week has been all about things chocolate!  This is a ‘just
        for fun’ international day to celebrate and we hope it will encourage the children to be
        more inquisitive about the world around them.  Can you find out when and where the chocolate
        chop was invented?</p>

        <h2>Clean Your Room Day</h2>

        <p>I wonder how many children did “clean up their rooms” on Friday? When asked in our Monday
        worship many claimed to have done so! (My desk certainly had a face lift!)</p>

        <h2>PTA</h2>

        <p>A very big THANK YOU to everyone who helped at the disco last Thursday – we made an
        amazing <strong>£300</strong>!</p>

        July</strong>. More information to follow.</p>

        <h2>Get Your Dancing Shoes On!</h2>

        dancing at this year’s Summer Fayre.  Rehearsals will start the first week back after half
        term.  Please contact <strong>Fran</strong> on <strong>07788436738</strong> for more
