<h2>Day For Change</h2>
<p>Thank you to those of you who sent back your ideas for "change" and "keep" in our village. It is not too late if you haven't sent in your ideas yet. Children enjoyed the day with some enjoyable changes in school. They also shared their ideas for change, It was lovely to see so many children dressed in the colours of the South African flag and we will be counting all of our "donated" pennies this week and sending it off to Woodford Primary School to buy seeds.</p>
