<h2>Day For Change</h2>
<p>Thank you to those of you who sent back your ideas for "change" and "keep" in our village. It is not too late if you haven't sent in your ideas yet. Children enjoyed the day with some enjoyable changes in school. They also shared their ideas for change, It was lovely to see so many children dressed in the colours of the South African flag and we will be counting all of our "donated" pennies this week and sending it off to Woodford Primary School to buy seeds.</p>

How does my child get into a school run club?
The forms for the clubs come out at the start of the year for all parents to book their children on. If the club is oversubscribed they will be offered a place on a waiting list to join the following term.  If you missed the sign up for a club and want to join midway through the year you should contact the teacher concerned.
Some of the clubs available throughout the year are Kitchen, art, ball, choir, chess, Maypole, puzzle, orchestra, netball, running and gardening.</p>

<h2>Lost Property</h2>
