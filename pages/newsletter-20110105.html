<h2>Happy New Year</h2>
<p>Welcome back to a snow free Term 3. 
Remember if we have copious amounts of 
snow please check 
the school website before setting out. We
 will do our utmost to stay
open even if we are here 
in our warm socks and slippers! Please 
encourage your children to wear scarves, 
ear muffs, hand warmers etc., so they stay 
comfortable at break and lunchtime. Health 
and safety regulations mean we have to 
draw the line at hot water bottles, however 
cute.</p>

<h2>Bike Raffle</h2>
<p>Thank you to those of you who bought 
tickets. The draw was held at the end of 
school and the Mendl family ticket was 
drawn - congratulations to them.</p>

<h2>Epiphany</h2>
<p>This week children will be learning about 
the traditions of Epiphany in Europe and 
"eating cake". Children who find a special 
favour in their cake will be crowned King or 
Queen for the day.</p>
