        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>This week our worships have been thought provoking with children discussing

        <h2>Milk Day</h2>

        <p>Last Wednesday was Milk Day and <strong>Matthew Darwall</strong> in <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> wrote:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“On Wednesday we had a milk day and in assembly we learnt the story of milk
        and we heard a milk song sung by cows!  Lots of classes did something about milk day and
        <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> sang a poem in assembly about cows”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Hat Day</h2>

        <p>Have you got your hat ready? Remember to wear a hat on <strong>Friday</strong> to remind
        us of the importance of talking care of our brains. Please bring your children’s hat design
        pages to school ready for judging on Friday morning in service.</p>

        <h2>Olympics</h2>

        <p>We are currently planning an Olympic event which may include a trip to watch the Olympic
        Torch en route to London. If any parents have access to details of the timings along the
        route on <strong>Wednesday 23rd May</strong> please let us know – searching on the net has
        not revealed these details yet!</p>

        <h2>Governing body</h2>

        <p>Your Governing Body works hard to support staff and pupils in making Churchill Primary
        School a great place to learn, work and play. This week we are continuing our series of
        governor profiles so that you may get to know your Governors better. You can also find out
        more on the school website – and look out for photos coming soon to the notice board.</p>

        <h3>Governors profile – John Votaw, Parent governor &amp; Vice-Chair</h3>

        <blockquote><p>“I became a Parent Governor in September 2006. I have a background in both teaching and
        management which I try to bring to the governing table. I feel parent involvement in the
        school is very important and was keen to add my voice.</p>

        <p>“I work with the Facilities Committee to keep track of the current and future maintenance
        needs of the school. I also take a special interest in the school’s IT infrastructure and
        development. I served as Chair of the governing body for four years and was impressed with
        the skills and commitment of the other governors and found it very easy to work with such a
        motivated group. With a daughter in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> and another in
        <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> I look forward to many more years of
        governing.”</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Christingle</h2>

        <p><strong>£109.00</strong> has been donated to the Children’s Society following the
        Christingle Candle service. Thank you for your kind donations.</p>

        <h2>Slap Cheek Syndrome</h2>

        <p>We are currently experiencing an outbreak of slap cheek in school. This illness is only
        contagious before the symptoms are visible. Advice from NHS Direct is that children do not
        need to be kept at home with this illness. Find out more by looking on the <a
        href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/slapped-cheek-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx">NHS
        Direct website</a>.</p>

        <h2>Lost property</h2>

        <p>We do have a number of items in the lost property bin outside <span
        class="yeargroup">Class 2</span> and we sometimes have other more precious or important
        items handed into the office. If you think you may have lost something please try us!</p>

        <h2>Chocolate Cake Day </h2>

        <p><strong>Friday 27th January</strong></p>

        <p>We are all looking forward to sampling a variety of cakes and learning about the
        ingredients in them.</p>

        <h2>Nestle vouchers</h2>

        <p>We are collecting Nestle box top vouchers which we can redeem for books or cash. If you
        have any Nestle cereals look for the voucher on the top of the box. We have a collection box
        by the fish tank in the main school foyer.</p>
