        <h2>Maths Teaching</h2>

        <p>Maths teaching is always changing, so attached to our Newsletter is an outline of how we teach division,
        addition, multiplication and subtraction.  The methods start with the simplest first and children build up to
        the more complex strategies.  They then use the strategy that they find the easiest.  If you are interested in a
        parents Maths evening, please let your child’s class teacher know.</p>

        <h2>Trips Out</h2>

        <ul>

          the Eqyptians.</li>
          <li>Year 6 visited Swindon this week to gain “first hand experiences” about World War 2.</li>
          <li>Year 1 spent the afternoon at Blaise Castle in a Victorian Classroom.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All classes had amazing experiences and positive comments on their high standards of behaviour from members
        of the public – well done to all of those children!</p>
