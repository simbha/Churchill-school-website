        <h2>Olympic Torch Day – Wednesday 23rd May</h2>

        <p>We are planning a full day of activities and would like to invite you to join us in the
        afternoon. At approximately <strong>1.30pm</strong> we will be touring the village with the
        children and our “Olympic Torch”, so wear comfy shoes and bring an umbrella — we will
        provide the route map!  Children can come to school dressed in sportswear of their
        choice.</p>

        <h2>Olympic Torch Competition</h2>

        <p>We will encourage the children to make an Olympic Torch. All of the torches will be
        carried around the village and one torch will be chosen as our main torch. So let your
        imagination run wild.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week is telling the truth.</p>

        <h2>Open Book</h2>

        <p>Last week we welcomed “the team” to our worship. They retold the story of the farmer who
        paid all his employees the same amount however long they worked. The question for the
        children was — fair or not fair?</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> Assembly</h2>

        <p>Thank you to the staff team and children for sharing their learning with us. They showed
        us the dance they performed at the Playhouse, tiles they had made, houses they had
        constructed and facts they had learnt. Well done to all of them.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done to those who received certificates:</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 2</th><td>Iris-May Spearing</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 4</th><td>Jack Taylor</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 5</th><td>Matthew Darwall</td></tr>
          <tr><th class="yeargroup">Year 6</th><td>Ben Hughes &amp; Daniel Bugg</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2>National No Socks Day</h2>

        <p><strong>Tuesday 8th May</strong> is National No Socks Day. We are going to use this
        national opportunity to raise funds for our partner school in South Africa. Children can
        come in their own choice of clothes wearing socks which are not on their feet, the brighter,
        more colourful, the better. How about wearing a sock on your hand. Pease bring a donation of
        <strong>20p</strong>. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Sports Relief</h2>

        <p>We have at last been able to count the money raised from Sports Relief and we have
        donated <strong>£191</strong>! Thank you for your generosity.</p>

        <h2>Walk To School Week</h2>

        <p>The week <strong>14th-18th May</strong> is Walk to School Week. Walk, scoot, cycle, hop,
        skip and jump - anything but motorised transport for the whole week! Daily tallies will be
        taken during registration apart from Wednesday when there will be staff at the two gates. A
        draw with prizes for those children who walk or otherwise all week will be held on
        Friday.</p>

        <h2>More About The Zoo Visit</h2>

        <p>What an amazing morning! The delight and enjoyment on the children’s faces was
        fantastic. We were so glad that the family who gave us this treat were able to join us for
        the event. The children learnt so much about animals’ habitats and the role of the zoo in
        our society now. Well done to everyone involved, especially the children who earned this
        treat through their improved lunchtime behaviour.</p>

        <p><strong>Emily</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“We learnt about lots and lots of different animals, their habitats and
        diets. We learnt that a Madagascan hissing cockroach has no teeth and some stick insects eat
        the same food for the whole of their life.”</p></blockquote>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> commented:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“We all thought it was fun. Dave was great, he let us touch the cockroaches,
        they felt spikey. Beans the rat was really cute”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>A Children’s View Of Lunchtimes</h2>

        <p><strong>Isabelle Stephenson-Cronk</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“I like <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> having role model badges which
        give us more privileges.</p></blockquote>


        <h2>Parking</h2>

        <p>A gentle reminder – please park outside Pudding Pie Lane entrance to drop off or collect
        children (kerb side). Park in the Stag and Hounds Public House to walk and use Larch Close
        entrance. Larch Close entrance is used for bikes and children walking. Please do not park in
        the entrance to Larch Close or the road alongside for the safety of our children. Thank
        you.</p>

        <h2>Parent Questionnaire</h2>

        <h3>…Could Do Better</h3>

        <p>Communication – we will ensure the key dates for the term will come out at the start of
        the term. These will include short helpful notes – see term 5/6 that came out last week. A

        <ul>
          <li>Details about events will be given more details on the newsletter well in advance so
          parents are always clear about requirements.</li>

          <li>We will remind teachers to send out letters e.g. about costumes, as early as possible
          – check your child’s bag on a Wednesday or get your letter by email.</li>
