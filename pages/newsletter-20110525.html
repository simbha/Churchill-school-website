        <h1>Newsletter - 25th May 2011</h1>

<h2>Mrs. Isgrove</h2>
<p>After many years of working at our school, <strong>Mrs Isgrove</strong> will be leaving at the end of this term. She has been an outstanding member of the staff team and will be greatly missed by children and adults. We wish her good luck in her future post.</p>

<h2>Year 4 And The Amphitheatre</h2>
<p><strong>William, Matthew, Ellen-Mai and Charlotte</strong> from <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> would like to inform you:</p>

<blockquote><p>"We helped <strong>Mr. Fletcher</strong> measure part of the field near our classroom. We are going to build an amphitheatre with steps that go up the bank. It will be used so that people can act out little plays at lunchtime. We'll tell you more later". </p></blockquote>

<h2>Assembly Theme</h2>
<p>The theme for the first week back will be about sharing.  This will encompass the school community, our village and extend to the world.</p>


<h2>Fact Of The Week</h2>
<p><strong>Libby Wilson</strong> and <strong>Connie Rawlins</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> found this interesting fact about teddy bears: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Teddy bears are a source of comfort and warmth. They are even used by the police to help calm children who have been traumatised by accidents and crimes".</p></blockquote>
