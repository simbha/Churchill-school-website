<h2 id="numeracy">Numeracy Evening</h2>
<p>We will be holding an informal numeracy evening on <strong>Thursday 10th February</strong> at <strong>18:15</strong>.
Current maths teaching in school may differ from how you were taught, so if you would like to like to learn more about how we teach maths then please come along. There won't be a test at the end!</p>

<h2>The Birds</h2>
<p>If you are thinking about trimming your hedges now is a good time to do it (Jan - Feb). After this period birds will be nesting and it is an offence to disturb or damage nests. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 protects nesting birds and if an offence is committed against this then a fine of up to £5000 can be imposed or possible imprisonment.</p>

<h2>Parents Working Party</h2>
<p>The Parents Working Party has reviewed the results of the recent Communications Questionnaire. Watch this space and the web site for answers to all your questions and suggestions. Thanks to everyone who took part.
If you have any questions or issues for us please catch one of us in the playground (we are on the notice board) or leave a note for us in the school office.</p>

<h2>Who Do I Ask?</h2>
<p>Parents often ask "How well mannered is my child in school?" The best person to talk to is your child's class teacher. They liaise with all the staff who work with out children. If you have concerns about your child's behaviour at unstructured times e.g. break and lunch then you can always ask for some detailed feedback. Your child's teacher will then talk to the lunch supervisors who will monitor over a week and feedback.
Please be assured that parents are contacted when we consider a child's behaviour needs improvement.</p>

<h2>Assembly Theme</h2>
<p>Next weeks theme is all about sharing.</p>

<h2>Governors Report</h2>
<p>A full governors meeting was held last week and certain aspects of life in the school were discussed. Mrs Tighe informed the governors that she had received complimentary letters from various members of the community who had either seen or heard our pupils taking part in activities. We also saw evidence of the 'special days' that are held in school and heard about what the children think of these days. Every Child Matters was also seen in action in a variety of ways including hearing about the answers to some of the questions our children had asked Woodford Primary School - see the displays in the entrance; and how we can forge greater links with this school and other schools both near and far.</p>
<p>The findings of recent research into the way we teach maths within school were also discussed and certain changes will now be made. You can find out more about this at a forthcoming curriculum evening.</p>
<p>All the committees updated us on their activities and the facilities committee asked the following:</p>
<p>The governors would like to ask if there are any parents who have the necessary carpentry skills to produce some storage for equipment that is used outside during playtimes. The specifications are available from Mrs Grant should anyone feel that they may be able to help. This is part of a staged development of the field area that the governors are financing from a fund specifically for school premises development.</p>
<p>At the end of each meeting the governors ask "What have we done for the children?" This is used to ensure that the meeting has been productive and important decisions have been made in order to keep the school moving forward in all areas.</p>
