        <h2>Well Done!</h2>

        <p>We were delighted to read The Times on 14th December which placed Churchill Primary
        School in the top ten schools in North Somerset. Thank you to every single member of staff
        who worked to make this possible. Parents play a huge role in supporting their children so
        thank you to you as well. Top five next year? Watch this space!</p>

        <h2>A Busy Week</h2>

        <h3>Monday – Maths Multiplication Day</h3>

        <p>Multiplication Day was a great success challenging children to recite tables quickly,
        solve codes to work out tables and even a multiplication Sudoku (that one was left in the
        staff room!).</p>

        <h3>Tuesday – Christingle Day</h3>

        <p>We all made Christingles in our classrooms before visiting St. Mary’s Church to
        celebrate. The school councillors presented their Christingles to be lit and <strong>Harry
        Fear</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> lit three of the advent
        candles. Boxes in the shape of candles were collected to raise money for the Children’s
        Society. We all enjoyed singing carols and celebrating Christingle. We would like to extend
        our warmest thanks to <strong>Mary Smallwood</strong> for donating all the ingredients for our Christingles
        and all the thoughtful preparation she provided. <strong>Louise Maitland-Round</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“I really enjoyed watching all the Christingles being lit they looked so
        bright and Christmassy!”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>Wednesday – Carol Service at St. John’s Church</h3>

        <p>Don’t forget you are all welcome to join us for the St. Johns’s Carol Service tonight at
        <strong>6.00pm</strong>. <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> will be leading the service
        with contributions from <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> recorders, the choir and the
        staff chime bar ensemble.</p>

        <div id="lunch">
        <h3>Thursday – Christmas Lunch</h3>

        <p>Is our annual family Christmas lunch and as usual there will be two sittings;
        <strong>11.45am</strong> for <span class="yeargroup">Reception, Years 1 and 6</span> plus
        siblings and family; <strong>12.45pm</strong> <span class="yeargroup">Years 2, 3, 4, and
        5</span> plus siblings and family. If you have booked to eat lunch, with your children
        please join your <em>youngest</em> child’s class for lunch collecting them from the
        playground before going to the hall. Due to the popularity of the lunch this year please do
        not come if you have not booked and paid.</p>

        <p>Although we appreciate it can be tricky, please leave all pushchairs outside the school
        in order to comply with Health and Safety regulations. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>The Choir</h2>

        <p>Our <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> Choir were treated to a delicious Christmas dinner
        at the Churchill Methodist Churchill Hall last Thursday. They were made to feel very welcome
        with crackers, turkey and all the trimmings. They sang some traditional carols beautifully
        after dessert. <strong>Lily</strong> and <strong>Mary</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“It was lots of fun, we enjoyed the minibus and our dinner. We’d love to go
        back!”</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Cinderella Rockafella</h2>

        <p>A fantastic performance from <em>all</em> the cast in <span class="yeargroup">Years 3, 4
        and 5</span> and <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> were superb in their parts both
        speaking and singing. I am sure in a few years time we will have to look out for a few
        ‘stars in the making’.</p>

        <p><strong>Tia</strong>, who played ‘Buttons’ and <strong>Finley</strong>, who played
        Anastasia, said they really enjoyed the experience and had fun on the stage even though they
