        <h1>Newsletter - 1st May 2013</h1>

        <p>Last week we had a full Health and Safety inspection in the school and around our
        grounds. A huge thank you to <strong>Mrs. Hosgood</strong> and <strong>Mr. Vickery</strong>
        for ensuring all was present and correct for the visit.</p>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>This week we have been learning about the miracles of life and bible stories about
        miracles. Next week we will be looking at people who are less fortunate than us through
        Christian Aid. Rev. Kate Sax joined for worship this week, the children all appreciate her
        stories and clear explanations of the meaning behind them</p>

        <h2>OfSTED Update</h2>

        <p>This week we received our monitoring report from our HMI, <strong>Jane
        Neech</strong>. The visit looked at the progress and work we have made since the
        inspection. Her full report is available in the office or at our Inspection Update meeting
        on <strong>May 8th at 7.30pm</strong>. The most important paragraph is:-</p>

        <blockquote><p>You and your senior teachers and governors are taking effective action to tackle the
        areas requiring improvement identified at the recent section 5 inspection. Following the
        visit to the school, we agreed that further action was needed to:-</p>

        <p>Ensure that the teacher with responsibility for leading mathematics, challenges teachers
        to guide pupils in lessons and mark their work so that pupils are clear about how to improve
        the quality of their work.</p></blockquote>

        <p>We were pleased to read that Jane Neech felt our action plan was “sharp with timely and
        appropriate actions”, that the school was being led in a determined manner and there a
        greater challenge especially for more able pupils.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Congratulations to <strong>Jude</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> for

        <h2>New Caretaker</h2>

        <p>Look out for our new caretaker, <strong>Mr Curtis</strong>, who we interviewed last
        Friday. We hope he will start after the half term break. A big thank you to <strong>Mr
        Vickery</strong> for all his support during this interim period.</p>

        <h2>Spelling And Reading Workshop</h2>

        <p>The Senior Leadership Team (SLT) led the literacy evening and had very positive feedback
        from parents. <strong>Mrs. Grant</strong> is preparing a hand-out which tries to capture the
        ideas/strategies and areas covered during the evening. We were disappointed at the number of
        parents who joined us but thank you to those who did.</p>

        <h2>Tell A Story Day</h2>

        <p>We all enjoyed listening to a variety of stories told at different times of the day
        around the school grounds. All were thought provoking and the children enjoyed the
        illustrations and rich language. A huge thank you to <strong>Mrs. Johns</strong> and
        <strong>Mrs. Farler</strong> for supporting this special day.</p>

        <h2>Netball</h2>

        <p>Last Tuesday, <span class="yeargroup">Year 5 and 6</span> played two matches against
        St. Anne’s School. There were some fantastic moments during the games and it was a fun
        learning experience for all.</p>

        <h2>Full Governors Meeting</h2>

        <p>The meeting this week will focus on the outcomes of our recent North Somerset maths
        review and the HMI monitoring report The Governors will also be considering the draft budget
        for 2013/14. <strong>Mrs. Furniss</strong>, Chair of Governors, will be reporting on the key
        action from this meeting in next week’s newsletter.</p>

        <div id="wts">
        <h2>Walk To School Without Socks - Wednesday 8th May</h2>

        <p>We are combining ‘Walk to School Day’ with ‘No Socks Day’. We are asking for a small
        donation to send to children in South Africa to buy socks as their winter approaches; many
        families are too poor to provide their children with socks. The class who has the most
        walkers will be rewarded. Why not park at the Stag and Hounds and enjoy the Spring sunshine
        on your toes.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Walking Treasure Hunt – 8th June 3–6pm</h2>

        <p>This is being arranged by the Village Fund and will be followed by a BBQ from <strong>6pm
        ish</strong> on the football club field. The new sound system which was part funded by the
        Village Fund/ PTA for community use will be used for the first time. More details to
        follow.</p>

        <h2>Churchill Brownies</h2>

        <p>Well done to all the Brownies who came 1st/2nd and 3rd in the recent district quiz.</p>

        <h2>Parent Questionaire Feedback Pupil Behaviour</h2>

        <p>Your comments ranged from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Children are always kind and gentle. </li>
          <li>Bad behaviour and bullying seem to be an on-going issue.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We have clear Behaviour and Bullying Polices, they are based on reconciliation
        techniques.</p>

        <p>A small number of children have personal behaviour plans which include sanctions and
        rewards. </p>

        <p>Behaviour is always judged at least good by agencies who visit numerous schools across
        the country.</p>

        <h3>North Somerset Principle Advisor (for all North Somerset Schools) July 2012</h3>

        <blockquote><p>“The school has very high expectations for conduct and behaviour. Pupils’ behaviour and
        safety is outstanding. Pupils are helpful, considerate and consistently behave well.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>OfSTED October 2012</h3>

        <blockquote><p>“Pupils demonstrate consistently positive attitudes to their learning and
        school life. Typically, pupils are polite and friendly, showing respect and kindness to each
        other regardless of age, race and culture. They report that bullying is rare but when there
        is some ‘silliness’ by a few pupils in the playground it is dealt with promptly and
        efficiently.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>SIAS March 2013</h3>

        <blockquote><p>“Churchill is an outstanding Church school founded upon the Christian values
        of unselfishness, respect and responsibility. The school’s Christian values are aptly
        demonstrated in the attitudes and behaviour of pupils of all ages and
        abilities.”</p></blockquote>

        <p>Sometimes children may not know what actions have been taken by staff following a child’s
        “bad behaviour” and this can sometimes lead to the opinion that “nothing has been done”. We
        are working to ensure parents are kept better informed and told earlier if their child’s
        behaviour is not appropriate.</p>
