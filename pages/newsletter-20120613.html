        <h1>Newsletter - 13th June 2012</h1>

        <h2>School Diamond Jubilee Street Party</h2>

        <p>Wow! What a fantastic afternoon we all had. A special thank you to all who donated food
        and drinks, staff, Governors, PTA, who helped to make this such a memorable event. Another
        big thank you to <strong>Mrs. Strawbridge</strong> and <strong>Miss Roberts</strong> for
        making the costumes for the Maypole dancing and planning the party which flowed seamlessly
        throughout the afternoon.</p>

        <p>Thank you to the Parish Council for the Jubilee mugs they presented to each child. The
        whole school photographs for each family were a gift from the PTA, we hope you will treasure
        them!</p>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>Next week the theme for our assemblies will be about looking after ourselves. </p>

        <h2>Village Jubilee </h2>

        <p>A huge thank you to so many PTA Committee and parents who cooked so skilfully throughout
        rain and shine – the onions were delicious. The event was very successful in bringing the
        village community together despite the soggy weather. <strong>Maisie</strong>,
        <strong>Edward</strong> and their attendants opened the fair with great professionalism. The
        school and Jubilee choir sang beautifully and the Maypole dancing by <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> was delightful. Thank you to
        <strong>Mrs. Strawbridge</strong> for making the outfits.</p>

        <p>There were some very clever children and adult fancy dress outfits which added to the
        colourfulness of the day. The live music in the evening was outstanding so a special thank
        you to Garry Sharp’s band Deep River Blue.</p>

        <h2>Geraniums For Sale</h2>

        <p>If you would like to buy some geraniums to brighten up your garden they will be available
        in the playground on <strong>Thursday</strong> and <strong>Friday</strong> at
        <strong>50p</strong> each, bags and honesty box provided! All proceeds to our village
        community.</p>

        <h2>Medicines In School</h2>

        <p>If your child needs to take any medicines during school time they should be given into
        the office and not stored in children’s bags. You MUST complete a “Medication Form” first
        (obtainable from the office) and one of our appointed first aiders will administer as
        necessary. Thank you.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> Folly Farm Residential</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> children had a magnificent time at Folly
        Farm. <strong>Charles</strong> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“I enjoyed Folly Farm, <strong>Jo</strong>, our activity leader looked after
        us from 8.00 in the morning to 10.00 at night. She was great in every single way and so was
        <strong>Claire</strong>, unfortunately she was only with us for the first day. Folly Farm
        was the best 3 days of school I’ve ever had, from the hollowed out wood that looked like a
        pair of shorts, to the games of camouflage and the fire making well, that was just
        extreme. If I had the chance I would so go again!”</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Sports Day – Wednesday 20th June</h2>

        <p>We hope you have received a flyer with information about our Olympic sports day. Your
        child will be taking part in events all day and will therefore need to come in appropriate
        kit for the whole day and bring a sun hat (hopefully) and a named plastic water
        bottle. Please see <strong>Mrs. Rowtcliff</strong> if you would like to help.</p>

        <p>Due to our lunchtime picnic there will no school dinners on the day. However, if you
        would like to order a school packed lunch, please let your child’s class teacher know by
        <strong>Friday, 15th June</strong>.</p>

        <p>In the event of bad weather our provisional alternative date will be <strong>Friday, 22nd
        June</strong>. We look forward to seeing you on the day.</p>

        <h2>Explorer Dome Visit</h2>

        <p>This <strong>Friday</strong> is Science Day. The children will be invited into the huge
        silver Explorer Dome which will be set up in the hall. The theme is Our Wonderful World
        exploring various scientific areas of our planet. Children will then continue this topic
        back in class. Many thanks to the PTA who have paid for this exciting event. </p>


        <h2>Picnic &amp; <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>Please join us for a picnic at <strong>12.30pm</strong> on <strong>Wednesday 20th
        June</strong> on the school field followed by an afternoon of Olympic team races from
        <strong>1.30pm</strong>. Cakes and refreshments will be on sale instead of <span
        class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> T@3 to enjoy with your picnic. If this is cancelled T@3
        will be held at the usual time on <strong>Friday, 22nd June</strong>. </p>

        <h2>French Day</h2>

        <p>On <strong>Wednesday, 27th June</strong> we will be having a French Day in
        school. Children are invited to come to school dressed in bleu, blanc et rouge (blue, white
        and red). There will be a special French menu for those having a school dinner, traditional
        stories told by a French story teller for <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> and <span
        class="yeargroup">KS2</span> and other surprises.</p>

        <h2>Dinner Money &amp; Menus</h2>

        <p>Dinner money until the end of term is <strong>£56.00</strong>. New menus are available
        from the office.</p>

        <h2>Fact Of The Week </h2>

        <p>There are more football clubs in England than anywhere else in the world. England also
        has the oldest football club, Sheffield. It has the oldest national governing body, oldest
        knockout competition, oldest national league and have produced the first national
        team. England’s Premier League is one of the most popular and richest sports leagues in the
        world and is home to some of the world’s most famous football clubs.</p>

        <h2>National Eat Your Vegetables </h2>

        <p>Next week is National Eat Your Vegetables week. Each day we will be encouraging children
        to try a different vegetable – so your children may be asking you to cook some new and
        unusual vegetables in the coming weeks!</p>

        <h2>Plates &amp; Tins</h2>

        <p>There are a number of plates and tins in our children’s kitchen which have been left from
        the Jubilee party. Please have a look to see if anything is yours.</p>
