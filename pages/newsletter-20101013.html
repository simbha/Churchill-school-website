	<h2>Our Harvest Day</h2>

	<p>By <strong>Elliot Legge</strong> And <strong>Matthew Darwall</strong> - <span
	class="yeargroup">Year 4</span></p>

	<p>In the entrance hall, at the beginning of the day, we felt proud because we saw loads of
	happy faces and lots of food. When we got into St. Mary's Church we found lots of mums and
	dads.  We felt quite nervous but we enjoyed our performance. We liked showing our work. Our
	harvest lunch stew smelt good enough to eat. Carrots, potato and beef stew; it tasted
	delicious. We had all taken turns to peel the vegetables. What a lovely day!</p>
