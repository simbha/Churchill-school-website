      <h1>Newsletter - 12th May 2010</h1>

      <p>It was delightful to be joined by Libby Cook for our Christian Aid Service this week.  She reminded 
the children to look out for their "envelopes"!  Have you filled yours yet?</p>

<h2>Farmer Nick</h2>

<p>Farmer Nick visited Class 3 this week - here is the report:</p>

<p>"Farmer Nick came from Alvis' Cheese Farm and told us how he made the cheese and bread which 
he sells at the farm.  He also keeps animals on the farm - cows and pigs."</p>

<p>By Toby Dibble.</p>

<h2>Reminder - Inset Days</h2>

<p>We have three Inset days attached to the Whitsun Half Term so the last day of School will be Friday 
28th May and the children will return to school on Thursday June 10th.  During these three days, 
staff will be learning new ways of making the curriculum more inspiring and encouraging pupils to 
work independently.</p>

<h2>Inspirational</h2>

<p>Members of the after school Kitchen Club spent the day at Cannington College building the garden 
they had designed.  A huge "thank you" to the parents who transported and helped and Mr 
Anderson and Mrs Churchill for their sterling work.  The children's garden was "Best in Show" - 
look at the website soon to see the project.</p>

<p>Middle Combe Nursery were very generous with their plants, so next time you need some good 
quality plants for your garden, do go and visit them.</p>

<h2 id="ws">Exciting Events</h2>

<p>The Year 2 Assembly -  the children chose their own topics to talk about and they ranged from 
Volcanoes to their visit to St Fagans, it was a fantastic reflection of their hard work.</p>

<p>The Year 4 Elections - the children divided into 5 parties for their election:</p>

<p>*	Laugh and Smile Party</p>
<p>*	Say Good Things Party</p>
<p>*	Sing and Dance Party</p>
<p>*	Do Good Things Party</p>
<p>*	The Exercise Party</p>

<p>The Exercise Party had the majority vote so next Wednesday morning we will all be having a 
"Wake and Shake" session in the playground after the bell goes at 8.55 - do please join us!</p>

<h2>Next Week's Services</h2>

<p>We will have the theme of "Pentecost and Friendship".</p>


<h2 id="party">Do You Want To Join?</h2>   
<p>Following a call for Volunteers in the February (Term 3) Questionnaire, a Parent Working Party has 
formed to provide a focus and discussion group for ideas and comments from parents.  This is very 
much an open group, so if you would like to join us, please come along on Tuesday 18th May at 
2.30 p.m.  A letter will follow shortly outlining our objectives and the current topics on the Agenda.</p>

<h2>Socks/no Socks</h2>

<p>Thank you for encouraging your children to take part in this event.  A grand total of Â£125 was 
raised (or 150 pairs of socks)!  These are being bought online from a Durban Manufacturer and sent 
to the school.</p>

<h2>Happy, But Sad</h2>

<p>Miss Corinne Higgins will be leaving us in July to take up a post at Wrington Primary School as 
Deputy Head.  Miss Higgins is a wonderful teacher and will be greatly missed.  We wish her every 
success in her new post.  We are currently recruiting for her replacement.</p>
