        <h2>Inspection Parents Evening</h2>

        <p>Last night we discussed the work we have undertaken since our Ofsted Inspection at our
        parents meeting. We were pleased to share the areas we have improved across the whole school
        and the impact we have had on children’s progress and achievement. We looked in more detail
        at the many positive comments in both the SIAS and Ofsted reports. Thank you to the staff,
        parents and governors who attended.</p>

        <p>Some comments from the report that parents felt were important were:-</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Achievement in reading is consistently good across the school.</li>
          <li>The most effective teaching is enthusiastic, well planned and tailored precisely.</li>
          <li>Pupils demonstrate consistently positive attitudes.</li>
          <li>Staff manage behaviour skilfully.</li>
          <li>The school is strongly committed to the nurture and care of all its pupils.</li>
          <li>There is a real family atmosphere in the school and this due to everyone working closely together.</li>
        </ul>
