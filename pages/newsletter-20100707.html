<p>An enjoyable time was had by all at the Rounders Festival - very well done to all who took part.</p>

<h2 id="photos">Class Photo Orders</h2>

<p>We are sending home today the proofs of the recent class photos.  Please return any orders by  the 
morning of <strong>Tuesday 13th July</strong> at the very latest, so that the photographs can be returned to school 
by the end of term.</p>

<h2>Inset Days For The Next Academic Year</h2>
<p>Please make a note in your Diaries of the following Inset Days commencing in the Autumn Term 
2010: The children will return to school on <strong>Thursday 2nd September</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wednesday 1st September 2010</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Thursday 14 October 2010</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Friday 15th October 2010</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Friday 22nd October 2010</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Friday 22nd July 2011</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We always try to avoid INSET days that are not attached to holidays. Unfortunately the training we 
require is only available in October. We hope that with ample notice it will not be too difficult to 
make arrangements for your child.</p>

<h2>School Dinner Menu</h2>

<p>Just a few spaces left in the Mad Science Club.  Please give applications to Mrs Strawbridge</p>

to dance at <strong>2.30&nbsp;p.m.</strong></p>
