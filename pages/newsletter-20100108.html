        <h1>Newsletter - 8th January 2010</h1>

        <p>Happy New Year – may 2010 bring you all that you wish for your family and friends!</p>

        <p>In February 2008 our OfSTED report began with “Churchill C.E.V.C. Primary School is a delightful place …”
        It was delightful indeed to come into school yesterday and find the paths cleared of snow!  Thank you to the
        parent and family who completed the sterling job!  Also thanks to Liz Folkes who spent Thursday afternoon
        sanding the paths and the parents this morning who made safe paths out onto the school field.  Thank you also to
        Miss Valerie Pain for updating the answer phone when I couldn’t get into school!</p>

        <h2>Thank You</h2>

        <p>Thank you for the many lovely cards and presents you and your children sent into school.  They are very much
        appreciated and enjoyed!</p>

        <h2>Really Important</h2>

        <p>In severe weather it may be necessary to close the school (as happened this week!).  We will endeavour to
        re-open, but if staff are unable to get here we will have no alternative but to remain closed.  Please refer
        to:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The North Somerset website  (<a href="http://www.n-somerset.gov.uk">www.n-somerset.gov.uk</a>)</li>
          <li>School Website (<a href="http://www.churchill-pri.n-somerset.sch.uk">www.churchill-pri.n-somerset.sch.uk</a>)</li>
          <li>School telephone – 01934 852446.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please check on Sunday evening after 9 p.m. or Monday after 7 a.m. to make sure that the school is open after
        the “expected snow” over the weekend.</p>

        <h2>Environmental Support</h2>

        <p>We will be collecting Christmas Cards for recycling, so if you want to drop them into your child’s classroom
        we will pass them on.</p>

        <h2>A Reminder</h2>

        <p>Please remind your children to bring coats to wear during break times, so they are able to enjoy all weather
        conditions!</p>

        <h2>Special Mention</h2>

        <p>Certificates were awarded to the following children – well done!:</p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Class R</th><td>Finley Dors</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Class 1</th><td>Thomas Risk</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Class 2</th><td>Alexandra Wilson</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Class 3</th><td>Emily Hurst &amp; William Pearce</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Class 4</th><td>Maddie Votaw</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Class 5</th><td>Nicholas Woodhouse &amp; Ben Bristow</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Class 6</th><td>Laura Guy</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>Football player of the week was Dylan Yandell</p>

        <h2>Unusual…</h2>

        <p>In the next couple of weeks you will notice a puppy in the playground. She is being trained as a Guide Dog
        for the Blind, so special permission has been granted to enable her to receive full training. Please follow the
        owners guidance on contact!</p>

        <h2>Remember</h2>

        <p>The school website is constantly updated by the Hurst family, pictures of children in the snow today will
        appear very soon.</p>

        <h2>Exciting News</h2>

        <p>Some parents will remember Mrs Clare Franklin (née Bale) who was a teacher at our school a few years ago.  We
        are delighted to inform you that she gave birth to a baby boy (William Gavin) on 22nd November (8 lb 7 oz).  I
        am sure you will join us in wishing Mr and Mrs Franklin every happiness with their new son.</p>

        <h2>Sweatshirts</h2>

        <p>New supplies of school sweatshirts are now in (please remember to name them !)</p>

        <h2>Dinner Money</h2>

        <p>School meals remain at £1.95 per day (£9.75 per week).  The amount required until half-term is £58.50.
        Please make cheques payable to “North Somerset Council”.  New menus are available in the School Foyer.</p>

        <h2>Found – Snowflake ear-ring</h2>

        <p>Have you lost a silver snowflake ear-ring over the Christmas period?  We have one in the school office if you
        have!</p>

        <h2>School Clubs</h2>

        <p>School Clubs start again week beginning Monday 11th January, 2010.</p>

        <h2>Message from Ms Joskey</h2>

        <p>I would like to say a huge “thank you” to everyone for all their kind words, cards and gifts at the end of
        last term.  Churchill Primary School will always be a very special place to me and it has been a privilege to
        work there over the last eleven years.  I wish you all a very happy 2010!</p>
