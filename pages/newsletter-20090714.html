        <h2>Term Times - Back In September</h2>
        <p>Just a reminder that we return to school on Friday 4th September as Thursday 3rd is an inset day.</p>

        <h2>Swimming - Urgent Request For Help</h2>
        <p>We are very sorry to see the departure of Mrs Caulfield from our team of swimming staff.  Over the past 
3 years she has taken responsibility for one of our swimming groups and her help will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>If you are an excellent swimmer, or swimming teacher, and feel able to help us regularly on a Tuesday 
afternoon (from 1.30pm) with Y3/4 swimming we would be delighted to hear from you.   You will need 
to undertake a North Somerset CRB check and the office has the necessary paperwork.  For safety 
reasons you are not required to enter the pool with the children.</p>

       
        <h2>Summer Fayre</h2>
        <p>Thanks must go to the PTA for organising this fantastic event and to all of you who helped out, attended 
and enjoyed the afternoon.</p>
<p>Thank you to all of the people who entered items in the arts and craft show and congratulations to 
the winners. A special thank you to the adults for their delicious cakes, scones and jam entries. The 
judges enjoyed sampling before they reached their difficult decisions!</p>

        <h2>Website</h2>
        <p>We are very appreciative to the Hurst family for all the work they have done to update and improve 
our web site. Certainly worth a look if you haven't visited recently and your comments would be 
gratefully received.</p>
