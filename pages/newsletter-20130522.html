        <h1>Newsletter - 22nd May 2013</h1>

        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>This week we have been celebrating discoveries including famous explorers and the
        discovery of X-rays and vitamins and what impact they have had on our lives. After half term
        our services will be about how helping others can make us feel happier.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Well done to the footballers of the week, <strong>Joachim Hullah</strong> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y2</span>) and <strong>Sam Ashford</strong> (<span
        class="yeargroup">Y4</span>)</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> Cheddar Trip</h2>

        <p>On Tuesday, 14th May, <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> were lucky enough to visit
        both the Cheddar Chocolate Company and St. John’s Church. The children became chocolate
        taste testers for the morning, and learned all about how the chocolates are made and
        packaged. They couldn’t believe their eyes when <strong>Mr. Sweet</strong> printed our
        school logo onto the wrappers of dozens of chocolates for us to share with the rest of the
        school. Many thanks to St. John’s Church for welcoming us when the unseasonal downpour meant
        we could not visit Cheddar Reservoir. A highlight of this visit was creating beautiful brass
        rubbings from the memorials inside the church.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> T@3</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> finished off a very busy week with a bustling and
        successful T@3. We would like to say a huge thank you to all the cake bakers, money takers
        and washer uppers who worked so hard to make sure all ran smoothly. A special thanks to
        <strong>Mrs. Takle</strong> and her green fingered husband who donated some plants to help
        raise funds for the school.</p>

        <h2>Tag Rugby</h2>

        <p>Well done to <span class="yeargroup">Year 5 and 6</span>, who won their Tag Rugby
        Tournament at Yatton Rugby Club on Friday. Everyone played with great skill and team
        work. Thank you very much to <strong>Mrs. Pearce</strong> and
        <strong>Mrs. Alexander</strong> for all their help with the event.</p>

        <h2>The Choir at St. Monica’s Trust</h2>

        <p>Thank you to all those who came to St. Monica Trust Sandford Station. The choir sang
        beautifully and gave great pleasure to the assembled audience. <strong>Mr. Loader</strong>,
        a teacher and story teller, will be working with us during term 6 to inspire children’s
        writing.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> End Of Term Service</h2>

        <p>Yesterday <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> attended an end of term service at
        St. Mary’s Church. Friends and families joined us as we celebrated and shared the highlights
        of our busy term. Many thanks to <strong>Mrs. Maitland-Round</strong> for hosting and
        closing our service.</p>

        <h2>Stranger Danger</h2>

        <p>We all strive to make our children independent, but please remind them of the dangers of
        walking alone, even around Churchill. We frequently remind children about ‘Stranger Danger’
        in our effort to keep them safe.</p>

        <h2>After School Behaviour</h2>

        <p>Please respect school equipment after the bell goes at <strong>3.30pm</strong>. The
        playground is not supervised so we ask you to ensure your children observe our after school
        playground rules.</p>

        <h2>ParentPay</h2>

        <p>We have the opportunity to update our payment system in school, so no more loose change
        or cheques to remember. ParentPay is a payment system that lets you make secure online
        payments. You can also pay in cash at local pay point stores. The online system is a more
        convenient and flexible way to pay for dinners and activities like school trips and music
        lessons. Please complete the slip on the paper version of this newsletter and return to the
        office so that we have a clear indication of your interest.</p>

        <h2>PTA</h2>

        <p>The next PTA committee meeting will take place at school on <strong>Friday 7th
        June</strong> at <strong>2.00pm</strong>.  Please come along – we will be planning the
        Summer Fete and would love some new ideas.</p>

        <p>The PTA would like to thank <strong>Kate Johns</strong> for her hard work this year. Kate
        is stepping down from her role as PTA Secretary.</p>
