        <h1>Newsletter - 26th September 2012</h1>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week will be communities including our village and South Africa.</p>

        <h2>Harvest</h2>

        <p>The school garden has been harvested; the vegetables have been prepared now all that
        remains for us to do is share our harvest feast! Our harvest service will take place at
        St. Mary’s Church at <strong>9.45am</strong>. After wandering back to school and admiring
        the autumn colours we will settle down to a harvest meal of chicken and vegetable stew and
        fruit crumble. We look forward to sharing our harvest celebrations with you and your
        families.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>This Friday sees the turn of <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> to host the T@3. This
        is a once a term event that enables parents to get together at <strong>3.00pm</strong>
        before they pick the children up and have a chat and cuppa. The host year will serve tea,
        coffee, homemade cakes and biscuits and all proceeds help towards something the class
        particularly wants.</p>

        <h2>The School Day</h2>

        <p>Now we are in full swing, we’d like to take this opportunity to remind you of our before
        and after school routines. In the morning the gates will be opened at
        <strong>8.45am</strong>. When the weather is fine the children should remain on the
        playground where a member of the Senior Leadership Team (look for the ladies in red!) will
        be there to greet them. Children should not need to enter the school building to drop off
        bags or belongings until they are collected by their class teachers once the bell has gone
        at <strong>8.55am</strong>. To encourage independence and responsibility we also ask that
        you let your child head into school and their classes by themselves. Scooters and bikes
        should also be left in the bike sheds before the children walk down to the playground using
        the path.</p>

        <p>Children should always use the school gates and NOT the entrance through the reception
        UNLESS it is after <strong>9.00am</strong>.</p>

        <p>After school <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage 1</span> classes will be dismissed by
        their class teachers from classroom doors when they have spotted the friendly face of a
        parent or friend. <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage 2</span> classes are dismissed
        independently from their classes. Scooters and bikes can be collected but must not be used
        in the playground so as to prevent any bumps and knocks to toddlers. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>International Peace Day</h2>

        <blockquote><p>“Peace lives in all of us. We just have to share it”.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Last Friday we joined millions of people from around the world to commemorate and
        strengthen the ideals of peace within and among all nations and people. In our service we
        shared peace hymns and spent a quiet moment reflecting on how we can create peace and
        harmony amongst our friends, family and in the wider community.</p>

        <h2>Open Afternoon</h2>

        <p>We ‘opened our doors’ a little wider this week when we opened up the school to the local
        community for an afternoon. Those who visited were shown around our warm and vibrant school
        by very proud <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> pupils. Visitors were also able to
        experience firsthand our ‘zest for life and learning’ as they joined children in their
        classrooms and wandered through our beautiful grounds and building. One visitor commented
        that “The children are very lucky to be in such a lovely school, I wish I was young
        again!”</p>

        <h2>Garden Workforce</h2>

        <p>Our new gardener Mrs. Smith would like to say “A huge thank you for all of your hard work
        on Saturday. A massive amount was achieved with a total of 42 people attending throughout
        the day! All the adults were amazing and even more amazing were the children that came to
        help. I was overwhelmed with the support. There is still so much to do, so watch out for my
        next date, so I can get you all involved again!! Good progress was made on Saturday but with
        your support I am excited about making more improvements to the school gardens. Thanks
        again”. </p>

        <h2>Footballers Of The Week</h2>

        <p>Well done to <strong>Rufus Clarke</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> and
        <strong>Thomas Risk</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span>.</p>

        <h2>School Council</h2>

        <p>The first student council meeting of the new school year was held last Friday. Here is a
        short report from our newly elected Chair and Vice Chair, <strong>William</strong> and
        <strong>Iason</strong>:</p>

        <blockquote><p>We have elected our school councillors for this year and we have
        already got some ideas. We are going to bring lots of fun and enthusiasm to the council and
        we are set for a really good year. We hope some of our fantastic ideas will be seen around
        school and we hope you like the ideas including:</p>
        <ul><li>fair football teams</li>
        <li>a more colourful playground</li>
        <li>improvement on the equipment rota</li>
        <li>more games</li></ul></blockquote>

        <h2>Holidays In School Time</h2>

        <p>Although we appreciate it is sometimes difficult to keep annual holidays in line with
        school holidays, it is worth noting that 72 educational sessions were lost to date due to
        holidays.</p>

        <h2>Inconsiderate Parking</h2>

        <p>We have had a number of complaints about the parking outside school during the drop off
        and pick up times. Some of the cases reported include; double parking to let children out,
        letting children out on the road side and parking on the corners. In Rule 217 of The Highway
        Code it states that:</p>

        <blockquote><p>‘you should not park within 10 metres of a junction or on a
        bend’</p></blockquote>

        <p>The car park in the school grounds is for staff only and not for dropping off and picking
        up.</p>

        <h2>Somerset’s Got Talent</h2>

        <p>Have you got what it takes to get up on stage and win a talent competition against touch
        opposition? Auditions will be held on <strong>Saturday 17th November</strong> with the
        competition on <strong>Saturday 1st December</strong> at
        <strong>7.00pm</strong>. Application forms from Churchill Post Office and St. Andrew’s
        Church Office on <strong>833126</strong>. Closing date for entries Saturday, <strong>3rd
        November 2012</strong>.</p>
