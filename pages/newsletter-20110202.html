       <h1>Newsletter - 2nd February 2011</h1>   
       
       <h2>Fact Of The Week</h2>
<p>This week was chosen by Maddie Robinson in Year 4, "If the population of China walked past you in single file, the line would never end because of the new Chinese people being born".</p>

<h2>Asda</h2>
<p>Very many thanks to ASDA in Weston for very kindly donating some of the refreshments for the PTA Quiz.</p>

<h2>Tickenham Golf Club</h2>
<p>The actual telephone number for Tickenham Golf Club is 01275 856626. The elderly gentleman has said how apologetic everyone has been! Very sorry for any inconvenience caused.</p>

<h2>Pta Quiz Night</h2>
<p>Questions were certainly quirky and the competition was strong with high scores for a number of teams. It was lovely to see previous and current staff and parents who came back to join in the fun. Well done to our Quiz Master and chefs.</p>

<h2>Assembly Theme</h2>
<p>The theme for next week is all about fear and being brave.</p>

<h2>Dropping Off</h2>
<p>Please be mindful of where you drop your children off. Always let them out on the pavement never the road side, into the oncoming traffic as was witnessed this week.</p>

change</h2>

what you would like to keep the 
same/change about school please do.

<p>This policy is available on the website for you to look at. Any comments please let us know by 12th February.</p>

<h2>Parents Working Party</h2>
<p>The Coffee Bite for this week is... 
Out of School Events
Your children are often invited to take part in out of school events. These are either school trips involving your child's entire class or events held in partnership with other schools or agencies which your child has been selected to take part in. In all cases your permission will be sought and you will be told the date, pickup/collection time, level of supervision, transport requirements (including whether you will need to take/fetch your child) and any food/drink you may need to provide. In all cases you will be told about insurance usually on the initial letter home. You will also be told whether you can or are required to attend the event or need to make arrangements with another parent to look after your child at the event (normally this is the case for after-school activities).
Class trips are always fully supervised by the class teachers, LSAs and any volunteer helpers. You will also be given specific information regarding any overnight trips organised by the school. On school trips the children will need to wear their school uniform or PE kit for a sporting event, unless you are advised otherwise. Often trips entail a monetary contribution from parents to cover the cost of transport, entry fees, to museums/attractions, road tolls etc. This is always kept as reasonable as possible but if you have any difficulties in meeting any trip costs please see you child's teacher.
If you have any questions do ask your child's teacher or a member of the Parent Working Party - a current list is on the noticeboard.</p>

<h2>Candlemas</h2>
<p>Thank you to the team of helpers, led by Libby Cook, who spent the afternoon in school teaching our children about Candlemas. A huge thank you to 
Mrs. Smallwood who supplied all the ingredients for the Christingles and to you for returning your filled candles with donations for the Children's Society. Please return empty candles so we can use them again next year.</p>
