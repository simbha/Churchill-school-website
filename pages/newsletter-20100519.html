      <h1>Newsletter - 19th May 2010</h1>


<p>Staff, parents and pupils frequently take part in fund-raising events, but Mrs Holdaway (our LSA in Year 1) needs a 
special mention.  Last Saturday Mrs. Holdaway completed the Moonwalk "The finishing line at 9.00am came as a 
welcome sight, having left Hyde Park at midnight. Watching the sunrise over the Thames feeling the heat of the 
sun appearing from the dark was amazing. 26.2 Miles didn't seem a long way to begin with, but boy it was! 
Feathers and laughter got us through the hours, but remembering why we were walking and who it would help. - 
"Breast Cancer " sustained us. If you wish to donate please drop into the office or see Mrs. Holdaway.</p>

<h2>Poem Written By Phoebe Samuel And Ben Hughes From Class 4</h2>


<p>Water,<br/>		
Wet bubbly,<br/>		
Rushing, gushing, crashing.<br/>
Water pounding on the rocks,<br/>
Waterfall.</p>
	
<p>Rain<br/>
Trickly, drippy,<br/>
Pounding, splashing, pouring<br/>
Rushing down the gutter.<br/>
Puddly</p>

<p>Streams<br/>
Gentle calm,<br/>
Flowing, running, rushing,<br/>
Blinking in the sun</p>

<p>Rivers<br/>
Water,<br/>
Pounding, splashing,<br/>
Bashing, crashing,<br/> 
smashing,<br/>
Shimmering in the golden sun,<br/>
Tsunami.</p>
