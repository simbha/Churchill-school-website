<h2>Progress Report - Anti-bullying Week</h2>

<p>Children had a fantastic week which culminated in each class sharing their work for the week in our 
Celebration Service.  Let's hope the lessons they learnt during this week will go with them always.  
Thank you to the staff for planning the work and inspiring the children.</p>

<h2>Pudsey Bear</h2>

<p>Everyone wore spots on Friday and enjoyed their tasty biscuits - many thanks to the Year 1 and the 
team!  Our children are so lucky in so many ways and this was an opportunity for them to 
understand other people's lives.  Just over £180 was raised - a fantastic result!  Many thanks to 
Blagdon Water Gardens for donating a raffle prize for the staff raffle.</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>

        <p>Player of the week was Matthew Young - very well done!</p>

        <h2>Service Theme</h2>

        <p>Our Service theme for this week is Advent/Christmas celebrations.</p>

       <h2>Word of the week</h2>
	   
	   <p>Dialectic - interesting!	</p>
	   
	   <h2>Year 6 Special Assembly</h2>
	   
<p>Because of the change of date for the Pantomime, Year 6 will now be holding their special 
assembly on Wednesday 2nd December at 9.10 a.m. and not on Friday 27th as previously notified  
Parents are warmly invited to attend.</p>
	   
	   <h2>Preparing For Christingle</h2>

<p>Thank you to Mary Smallwood and Libby Cook who will be in school on 10th December to share a 
Christingle Service with the children.  If you would like to join us to help the children to make their 
Christingles in the afternoon, please contact your child's class teacher.</p>

<h2>Pushchairs</h2>

<p>We are always struggling to keep our carpets clean in school, but have noticed that some parents 
push their pushchairs through our corridors.  Please leave these outside as a lot of dirt and germs 
come off the wheels and onto our carpets!!!</p>

<h2>Photographs</h2>

<p>Please return your photograph orders before the end of their week if possible.  Proofs should be 
returned even if you do not wish to order any.  Many thanks.</p> 

<h2 id="ChristmasDinner">Christmas Dinner</h2>

<p>Last orders for our Christmas Lunch on 16th December is on Thursday (26th November) - no other 
orders can be accepted after this date - £1.95 per child £2.30 per adult.  Lots of traditional 
Christmas Fayre as well as a vegetarian option!</p> 


<h2>PTA Children's School Colouring Competition</h2>

<p>Make sure your entry is put up in your window by Friday evening (27th November) ready for the 
secret judging!</p>

<h2>Youth Speaks</h2>

<p>Last night, two teams from Year 6 took part in the "Youth Speaks" competition, run by the Rotary 
Club of Wrington Vale.  The first team, Georgina Savage, Jasper Badger and Ollie Callow spoke on 
the subject of "5 a day - is it worth it?" reminding the audience of just how important it is to eat a 
healthy diet.  The second team, Dulcie Davies, Isla Hurst and Jack Slingsby, informed the audience 
of the dangers of too much exposure to the sun in their talk "The Sun Friend or Foe". 

 Both teams are to be congratulated on their excellent performances and the "Hearty Eaters" have 
been invited to take part in the regional finals next Spring - well done to all!</p>
