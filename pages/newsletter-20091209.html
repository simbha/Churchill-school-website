<h2>Christingle</h2>

<p>

Every year Christingle services are held in schools and Churches around

the country to raise money for 'The Children's Society'. The Children's

Society is a leading children's charity committed to making childhood

better for all children in the UK The Children's Society works daily to

rescue and support disadvantaged children who face violence, neglect and

poverty in their daily lives. The 6000 Christingle celebrations around

the country play a big part in raising the money needed to provide this

support.</p>



  <p>'I was living in a car park when The Children's Society found me. Bad

  stuff happened on the streets, but now I'm not afraid anymore'</p> 



<p>Every Year 100,000 children and Young people run away from home. The

Children"s Society is here to help. They have specialist project workers

around the country helping children like Ben,



But they can't do this without your support. Act now. Make childhood

better. £10 could provide a homeless child on the streets with basic

provisions including warm clothing, toiletries and a blanket.</p>



<p>Christingle prayer</p>



  <p>May Christ, the Light of the World,

  shine in our hearts and lives

  so that we may be filled

  with his joy and peace.

  Let us go in the light of Christ

  to bring light and love to those whom we meet.

  Amen </p>
