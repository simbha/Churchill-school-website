		  <h1>Newsletter - 21st September 2011</h1>

		  <p> As autumn weather descends our thoughts are turning to harvest. We hope as many children
		  as possible will join us for ‘home grown’ lunch on <strong>Thursday 29th September</strong>
		  around mid-day. Get your slip in quickly as space is limited and booking closes tomorrow,
		  and we need to know numbers for catering. Details and timings to follow.</p>

		  <h2>Harvest</h2>

		  <p>Our service this year will take place at St. Mary’s Church at <strong>10:00</strong> on
		  <strong>Thursday, 29th</strong> for the whole school. Please join us (it will be a very full
		  church) and take part in this delightful service of hymns, prayers, poems and readings. We
		  are asking each child to bring a gift of food, home produce from your garden or dried goods;
		  these will then be passed to the Children’s Hospice in Wraxall who will use them to make
		  meals for the children and their families, so please give generously. Children should bring
		  their donations to school on Thursday where they will then carry it to church.</p>


		  <h2>International Peace Day</h2>

		  <p>Today we marked this very special day which is working towards a day of cease fire and
		  non violence world wide. The children sang beautifully…. We believe one day we will see a
		  world in peace and harmony…. We are the future, we are tomorrow, we are the peace that you
		  all crave.</p>

		  <h2>Assembly</h2>

		  <p>The theme for next week is Harvest to include harvests around the world.</p>

		  <h2>Open Day</h2>

		  be opening our school for any prospective children and parents to look round. </p>

		  <h2>T@3</h2>

		  <p>This week <span class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> will be hosting T@3. Any <span
		  class="yeargroup">Year 1</span> parents wishing to help or supply cakes please see
		  <strong>Mrs. Strawbridge</strong>.</p>

		  <h2>Parent Working Party</h2>

		  <p>Last year we had a very active group of parents who met monthly to support the school
		  with practical help and ideas. If you would like to be part of this group or want to find
		  our more please come and talk to <strong>Mrs. Tighe</strong>. We are currently looking for
		  help with some painting so if you have a spare hour or two we will be pleased to hear from
		  you. Thank you.</p>

		  <h2>Swimming</h2>

		  <p>Thank you to those of you who have already returned the questionnaire can we have any
		  others in by this <strong>Friday</strong>.</p>

		  <h2>Dog poo</h2>

		  <p>Unfortunately there have been a few occasions this week where we have had to clean up
		  after dog mess that has been brought into school. If you see anyone fouling the pavement
		  please ask them to clean up after their dogs. If caught they could be liable to a fine of up
		  to £1000.</p>

		  <h2>School Council</h2>

		  <p>Thank you to last years group who worked hard to ensure that our children’s school
		  continued to improve. We will announce this years school council shortly.</p>

		  <h2>Apologies</h2>

		  <p>Another Bristol Half Marathon competitor has come to light Governor <strong>Tristan
		  Wilson</strong>, so now we have all of our senior leadership team, our Chair of Governors
		  and Chairs of Curriculum and Management Committees ‘running’ our school. Watch this space
		  next year!</p>

		  <h2>Worry dolls</h2>

		  <p>We have a dozen ‘Worry Dolls’ for children to borrow. Traditionally the children tell the
		  dolls their worries and then put the bag under their pillow overnight. If your child would
		  like to take one home they are in the main school foyer. Please ensure your child returns
		  the doll after a couple of days. Thank you.</p>

		  <h2>School uniform</h2>

		  <p>We are delighted to inform you that at last we now have a stock of school sweatshirts and
		  book bags.</p>

		  <h2>The Giving Machine</h2>

		  <p>Nine people so far have signed up to the Giving Machine website. This is a site that
		  lists major companies i.e. Amazon, Next, John Lewis, Sainsburys (to name but a few). When
		  you enter these sites via The Giving Machine a donation will be made to your chosen
		  beneficiary. It is simple and easy to use and a great way for the school to earn extra funds
		  and it doesn’t cost you anything.</p>

		  <h2>Staff car park</h2>

		  <p>Please refrain from using the staff car park. </p>

		  <h2>Churchill Academy &amp; 6th Form Centre</h2>

		  <p>Parents and children of children attending the Academy in September 2012 can attend the
		  Parents Evening on <strong>Wednesday 28th September</strong> from
		  <strong>18:00-21:00</strong>. This is an opportunity to look around the school to see what
		  they have to offer.</p>
