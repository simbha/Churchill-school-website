        <h1>Newsletter - 4th January 2012</h1>

        <p>We started the New Year thinking about working as a team – see how many aspects your
        children can remember:-</p>

        <p><strong>N</strong>	Never be selfish, always share<br/>
        <strong>E</strong>	Enjoy your family members<br/>
        <strong>W</strong>	Work together and support each other<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Y</strong>	You are always determined to succeed<br/>
        <strong>E</strong>	Ensure that you are creative<br/>
        <strong>A</strong>	Always have a purpose each day<br/>
        <strong>R</strong>	Religion plays an important part in our lives</p>
