	<h1>Home/School Agreement, September 2010</h1>


	<p>Churchill Primary School prides itself on being a caring school where pupils enjoy learning and
	reach their full potential in a Christian environment.</p>


	<p>We ask each child and family to support us in this aim through our “Home/School Agreement”.</p>

	<p>As a <strong>school</strong> we will endeavour to:</p>

	<ul>

	  <li>Provide an interesting, balanced education that strives to meet each child’s individual needs,
	  in an atmosphere conducive to learning.</li>

	  <li>Provide a supportive, caring and stimulating environment, where children can confidently ask for
	  help and advice on any matter.</li>

	  <li>Promote a Christian ethos.</li>

	  <li>Work in partnership with parents.</li>

	  <li>Keep parents informed about school activities through regular letters home, our school website
	  and an “open door” policy.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>The school is committed to providing opportunities for professional development of staff to
	maintain and improve the standards of teaching.</p>

	<p>We ask <strong>parents</strong> to:</p>

	<ul>

	  <li>Be involved in their child(ren)’s education and the life of the school.</li>

	  <li>Support children in homework and other opportunities for home learning.</li>

	  <li>Attend parents evenings and discussions about their child(ren)’s progress.</li>

	  <li>Let the school know of any concerns that might affect their child(ren)’s work or behaviour</li>

	  <li>Ensure that their child(ren) wears school uniform, is properly equipped and ready for work.</li>

	  <li>Inform the school as soon as possible if their child(ren) is unable to attend school and ensure
	  that they arrive and depart from school at the appropriate time.</li>

	  <li>Consider walking to school whenever possible to ease traffic congestion.  Use the “park and
	  walk” facility from the Stag and Hounds</li>

	</ul>



	<p><strong>Pupils</strong> promise to:</p>

	<ul>

	  <li>Listen carefully and follow instructions</li>

	  <li>Follow the agreed classroom rules</li>

	  <li>Work hard in class, do my best and allow others to do the same</li>

	  <li>Complete my homework and return it on time</li>

	  <li>Remember to pass letters between home and school immediately</li>

	  <li>Take care of the school environment</li>

	  <li>Bring all the equipment I need every day</li>

	  <li>Wear the school uniform and take pride in my appearance</li>

	  <li>Show consideration of others feelings, cultures and beliefs</li>

	  <li>Display high standards of behaviour inside and outside the school and on visits</li>
	</ul>
