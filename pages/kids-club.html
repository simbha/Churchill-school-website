        children from Churchill Primary School. Our Ofsted ID is EY376403. Sessions are led by qualified staff with a
        parents’ committee in charge of organisation.  We take up to 16 children per session.  </p>

        <h2>Play workers</h2>

        <p>Valerie Pain and Sharon Schroeder both work at the school during the day and Anna Lee works at Churchill
        Pre-school during the day.  Sylvia Pain often comes into school to do craft activities with the children acts as
        cover.</p>

        <h2>Our hours</h2>

        <p>7.45-8.45am and 3.30 to 5.45pm.  Children may also come on to us after finishing any of the after school
        clubs.</p>

        <h2>Prices</h2>

        <p>Family registration is £12. Single morning sessions are £3.20 per child with a discount for a full week,
        afternoon ones are £4.30 up to 4.30pm and £6.90 up to 5.45pm with reductions for subsequent children from the

        <h2>Where are we based?</h2>

        <p>Mornings in the hall and in the afternoons either in Key Stage 1 or in the playground.</p>

        <h2>Games and Play</h2>

        <p>In the mornings the sessions are based in the main hall and involve arts and crafts, board or card games or
        just racing about being active!  In the afternoon we try to let the children play outside as much as possible to
        let off steam after the school day.  If we are inside we offer crafts, games, reading, homework time.</p>
