        <p>We are sorry to announce that the Festive Fun Run which was to be held on

        many people would be involved in the Christmas Fayre it would be impossible to really take
        full advantage of this special event. Thank you to <strong>Mrs. Vickery</strong> and
        <strong>Mrs. Williams</strong> for their planning work – which they will use to organise the
        spring run.</p>
