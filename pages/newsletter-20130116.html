        <h1>Newsletter - 16th January 2013</h1>

        <p>Winter is here at last and the children have been enjoying the frosty grass and
        remembering to stay off the trim trial until the sun has done its work!</p>

        <p>Please remember children may find gloves and hats useful on cold lunch times.</p>
