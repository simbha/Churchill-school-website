	<h1>Newsletter - 26th January 2011</h1>

	<p>We went Wassailing very noisily! A great time was had by all the children who gained a
	greater understanding of this Somerset tradition. Kerry Louise Wilkinson and Matthew
	Woodhouse were crowned King and Queen for the day and everyone benefited from extra
	playtime to celebrate. We are looking forward to a good harvest of apples this year.</p>

	<h2>The Big Breakfast</h2>

	<p>A huge thank you to the parents, staff, cooks and governors who came to help cook and
	serve the breakfast which over 100 children enjoyed. We are continuing our breakfast theme
	on our roundabout table where this week children can taste a different cereal every day.
	Research shows breakfast is an important meal so please encourage your children to start the
	day well!</p>

	<h2>Fact of the week</h2>

	<p>Chosen this week by Alfie Winter in <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>:</p>

	<blockquote><p>"The Chow has a blue tongue and is the Chinese word for food, apparently because it is so
	tasty to eat!"</p></blockquote>

	<h2>Golf at half term</h2>

	<p>Tickenham Golf Club are offering free lessons during the half term break. Please call
	them for more details on <strong>01275 856620</strong></p>

	<h2>PTA quiz night</h2>

	<p>Tickets available from the office or your class rep. Lovely night planned with quirky
	questions and fabulous food. Start gathering around <strong>19:30</strong> for pre-quiz drink.</p>

	<h2>National nest box week </h2>

	<p><strong>14th-20th February</strong>. Many birds are in serious decline, especially
	sparrows, so building a nest box will help local populations. The RSPB website gives details
	on how to make a nesting box. Could be a good project for half term.</p>

	<h2>Assembly theme</h2>

	<p>Next weeks theme is Candlemas.</p>

	<h2>Lunchtime supervisors</h2>

	<p>1 had a very successful meeting with the Lunchtime Supervisors this week, and we are going to
	be implementing some changes.</p>

	<p>A group of <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> pupil volunteers will be trained to take on
	the role of "Playground Buddies". They will offer a variety of structured play activities at
	lunchtimes on a Tuesday and Friday. One of the activities is 'dressing up' so if you have
	any old clothes or shoes that would be suitable they would be much appreciated. Another
	activity is dance/music; CDs will be monitored to make sure the words are appropriate!</p>

	<p>The supervisors are concerned that a few Children in <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage
	1</span> are throwing their lunch in the bin. To stop this happening the bin is going to be
	removed from the hall so children will bring home all their empty containers. This may help
	you to know exactly what your child has eaten! If your child has a yogurt or something
	similar please can you provide the cutlery necessary as very often the children use school
	cutlery which disappears home!</p>

	<h2>Wanted</h2>

	<p>Any complete games your child has grown out of and any DVDs with a 'U' rating would be
	much appreciated for use during wet play.</p>

	<h2>Blood Brothers</h2>

	<p>Winscombe Youth Theatre productions present Blood Brothers at Churchill Community School
	on <strong>4th</strong> and <strong>5th February</strong> from
	<strong>19:00</strong>. Tickets available from the Community School on <strong>01934
	852771</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Be an artist for the day</h2>

	<p>Many thanks to all of you who purchased Christmas cards. The profit from this has enabled
	us to bring an artist into the school for the day on <strong>Monday 31st
	January</strong>. All the children will be assisting a visiting artist in creating a fresh
	mural on the tiles in the hall. As this task could be a little messy we ask that all
	children come to school in old clothes on that day. The 'arts' theme will continue
	throughout the day in children's classrooms.</p>

	<h2>Parents working party</h2>

	<p>This weeks Coffee Bite is&#x2026;</p>

	<blockquote><p>"What happens to my child at Lunchtime?"</p></blockquote>

	<p>At <strong>12:15</strong> <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage 1</span> children break for
	lunch and go to the Hall for their hot dinner or sandwiches. They are looked after by the
	dinner supervisors who encourage your child(ren) to eat as much of their hot lunch or
	sandwiches as they can.</p>

	<p>During this time <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage 2</span> children finish their morning
	session. They go into the Hall for their lunch, around <strong>12:50</strong>. During this
	time <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage 1</span>	children have use of the playground.</p>

	<p>At <strong>13:00</strong> <span class="yeargroup">Key Stage 1</span> and <span
	class="yeargroup">Key Stage 2</span> children play together until the end of lunch.</p>

	<p>The dinner supervisors organise games and Playground Buddies will approach lone children
	to help them find a game to play. There are set days for each class to play games such as
	football and the playground is zoned, providing a range of areas such as quiet
	places.</p>

	<p>Children can come into school to get a drink or visit the toilet, and indoor activities
	are organised when the weather stops them going outside. If you have any further questions
	please see a member of the Parent's Working Party or your class teacher.</p>

	<h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span>'s visit to St. Mary's church</h2>

	<p><strong>Louise</strong> and <strong>Isobel</strong> wrote:</p>

	<blockquote><p>When we went to the church <strong>Mrs. Cooke</strong> showed us a video
	about the baptism of Jesus. Then we acted out a modern christening. <strong>Louise</strong>
	was the mum, <strong>Finley</strong>, the dad and the baby was name 'John', We celebrated
	the occasion with Jaffa Cakes and Ribena.</p></blockquote>

	<h2>Churchill's got talent</h2>

	<p>Congratulations to all participants. Finals will be held next <strong>Thursday
	3rd</strong>. Well done to the <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> girls who have taken on
	this enormous challenge to organise such a huge event. <em>Fantastic</em>. The show will
	start at <strong>15:45</strong> and tickets will be sold on the door if you haven't already
	got yours. Cost is <strong>Â£1</strong> for adults, <strong>50p</strong> for children and

	<h2>Home from school update</h2>

	<p>A letter of thanks to all those who completed the Home from School questionnaire in
	October. As a result a Holiday Club at Blagdon School will be opening during the half term
	break. Half day and whole day sessions from <strong>07:45</strong> are
	available. Registration forms available from the office or for more information contact
