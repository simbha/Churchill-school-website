	<h1>Newsletter - 17th November 2010</h1>

	<p>As the days become colder and darker please remind your children of the need to bring a
	coat to school and to be vigilant when walking to and from school. We often have comments
	from members of the community about cyclists without helmets and children not walking on the
	pavements.</p>

	<h2>11.11.11 </h2> 

	<p>The children observed two minutes silence and learnt the history behind Remembrance Day.
	They also thought of current day members of the armed forces and their roles in future world
	peace. We sang the Peace Song and would like to share the chorus with you:</p>

	<blockquote><p>
	  No wars will stop us singing;<br/>
	  Our voices will stay strong<br/>
	  Even through the darkest night<br/>
	  We will sing our song<br/>
	  <br/>
	  No fear will stop us dreaming;<br/>
	  Our dreams will light the sky.<br/>
	  Even when all hope is gone<br/>
	  Our dreams will not die.
	  </p></blockquote>

	  <p>Well done to <strong>William Maitland-Round</strong> for playing the last post.</p>

	  <h2>Book Characters</h2>

	  <p>Thank you to the parents who encouraged their children to come to school as a book
	  character last week, we had an amazing array from Augustus Glup to a Zombie.</p>

	  <h2>The Book Fair</h2>

	  <p>Thank you for your fantastic support at last week’s book fair. It was lovely to see so
	  many children inspired to read by the many beautiful books on sale. Your generosity raised
	  a total of <strong>£203.61</strong> commission that will be spent supporting our
	  children’s curriculum.</p>

	  <h2>The Jigsaw Afternoon</h2>

	  <p>The children visited far flung lands by moving around the classrooms. The staff had
	  some wonderful stories and resources they shared with the children to make it an exciting
	  afternoon. Many thanks to <strong>Mrs. Grant</strong> for her organisation of the events.</p>

	  <h2>The Parents Working Party</h2>

	  <p>The Parents Working Party are currently undertaking a review of “Alternative methods of
	  home school communication”. If you haven’t returned your questionnaire there are spares in
	  the office and a box to post them in the entrance hall.</p>

	  <h2>Talented Talkers</h2>

	  <p>Last night two teams from <span class="yeargroup">Class 6</span> entered the Rotary
	  Club Annual Youth Speaks competition. The team of <strong>Kerry Wilkinson</strong>,
	  <strong>William Maitland-Round</strong> and <strong>Euan Taylor</strong>, shared their
	  concern about the number of endangered animals there are now in the world and informed the
	  audience of what they could do to help.</p>

	  <p>The Sportsmen team of <strong>Isobel Fowles</strong>, <strong>Chloe Blakemore</strong>
	  and <strong>Euan Campbell</strong>, told the audience why they thought a little less money
	  should be spent on the Olympic games in 2012 and a little more spent on sporting
	  opportunities for young people. </p>

	  <p>Both teams were amazing and spoke confidently and enthusiastically about their chosen
	  topics. Twelve teams took part in the competition so we are very proud to announce that
	  The Sportsmen won overall. Well done to all!</p>

	  <h2>Tom &amp; Kylan’s Report</h2>

	  <p><strong>Tom Williams</strong> and <strong>Kylan Green</strong> reported on the visit of
	  <strong>Mr. Salmon</strong>:</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <h3>Tom</h3>
	    <p>On Monday morning <span class="yeargroup">Class 4</span> were visited by
	    <strong>Mr. Salmon</strong>, a retired vicar. Last week everybody wrote a question for
	    <strong>Mr. Salmon</strong> to answer and we took it in turns to say our question. I
	    asked him what it was like being a vicar and he replied, “Sometimes happy and sometimes
	    upsetting”.</p>

	    <h3>Kylan</h3>
	    <p>Our favourite part was when <strong>James</strong> dressed up as a vicar. He wore a
	    black cassock with a white surplice on top and around his neck he had a
	    chasuble. <strong>James</strong> looked funny because it was way too big!
	    <strong>Mr. Salmon</strong> told us he wore a dog collar so that everyone would
	    recognise he was a vicar.</p>
