<h2>Y4 Trip To Bristol Museum</h2>

<p>William Pearce and Emily Hurst wrote about their trip "On Wednesday 9th February class 4 went on a school trip to the Bristol history museum. We learnt a lot about the Ancient Egyptians and lots of other things to do with history. Just before lunch we went into the Egyptian workshop and handled some artefacts that were over 2,000 years old. After lunch some of the groups went and explored some of the parts of the museum. Overall we had a brilliant time".</p>

<h2>Assembly Theme</h2>

<p>The theme for next week is all about Lent.</p>

<h2>Trip To South Africa</h2>

<p>Four ex primary school pupils are going on a trip of a lifetime to a village in South Africa to take part in community projects. They think this is a wonderful opportunity and are determined to raise the funds to go. One of their first fundraising ideas it to collect old mobile phones - if you have any phones you could donate, working or not, please take them to the office. 
They are also available for any gardening duties, digging, mowing, assisting with hedging, dog walking or general things that you don't want to do! Please see Mrs. Folkes in the office.</p>

<h2>Lost Property</h2>

<p>We have found the book The Children's Encyclopaedia of "Animals" outside. If you think you have lost it please call into the office.
Benjamin West lost his coat with his name in it after the disco, has anyone found it?
There is also a huge amount of clothing in the lost property bucket including bags, shoes, trainers etc. Please check to see if anything belongs to you as we will be taking it to the charity shop next week if not reclaimed.</p>

<h2>St. David's Day</h2>

<p>Congratulations to the choir who helped us
 to celebrate St. David's Day with a 
beautiful song "Heno"  Children enjoyed
drawing leeks and daffodils which will be 
on show next week and learning about
Welsh customs from Mrs. Williams and 
Miss Mullins. 
Thank you to the Hobson family  for the
lovely Welsh cakes!</p>

<h2>Fact Of The Week</h2>

<p>This week Year 1 has offered this fact "Welsh people eat welsh cakes, they are flat and round with raisins inside and 
bore da is good morning".</p>

<h2>Fruity Friday</h2>

<p>This Friday will see the start of our new Fruity Friday campaign where we are trying to encourage children to eat fruit at playtime. Please try to encourage your child to take part.</p>

<h2>Health And Safety</h2>

<p>Please keep prams and push chairs to a
minimum in the building.
Children in KS1 exit onto the playground
from their classroom doors when they are
matched with "an owner".
In KS2 with 120+ children leaving at one
time please ensure you don't congest the
corridors at the end of school by waiting in
the playground. Thank you.</p>

<h2>Round Table</h2>

<p>This week Charlotte Wilkinson and Jemma McCoubrey in Y3 have set up our round table. They are asking children to guess the names of their teddies. Well done to them for their organisation and presentation skills.</p>

<h2>Parents Working Party</h2>

<p>The Coffee Bite/Chunk for this week is... 
Marking children's work is very important because
It help them to know how well they are doing and what they need to do next. If your child is in YR/1/2 you will often see a tick and 'v' on their work, this means the teacher has discussed their work and told them how to make it "even better".
In Y3/4/5/6 you will often see written comments from the teacher - EBI (even better if) and then the children follow the advice from the teacher and update the work.
WWW (what went well) comment tells the children their strengths success and how well they are doing.
Children put smiley or sad faces on their work to indicate whether they understood or not. Sometimes children "mark" each others work and offer helpful comments.
Maths work may sometimes be marked by the class with the teacher then looking at the marking in the evening.
If you want to find out more about marking, the policy will be up on the website soon. In the meantime TTT (talk to teacher) or your child.
Hope your coffee is still hot, that was a long but important one this week!</p>
