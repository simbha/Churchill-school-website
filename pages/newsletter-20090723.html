        <h1>Newsletter - 23rd July 2009</h1>

        <p>Well, what a busy school year we have had!  From the New London Chamber Ensemble in school in September to
        our T@3’s, to our Y6 Residential, to our wonderful Christmas performances, to pancakes, to the French Café, to
        our Y6 Leavers service today.  So many events and too many to mention them all.  I am sure everyone has their
        favourite.</p>

        <p>I hope you all have a wonderful summer.  I wish our Y6 children success and happiness for the future and I
        look forward to seeing everyone else in September ready for another exciting, busy and fulfilling year.</p>

        <p>On a more serious note, if necessary, we will be using the school website to communicate any information for
        parents regarding swine flu during the summer holiday in preparation for the September return to school.</p>

        <h2>Message from the PTA</h2>

        <p>The PTA wanted to thank all the parents, friends and teachers of the school for helping us to organise the
        summer fair. We hope you all enjoyed the afternoon. We are still working out the final sum of money and will let
        you know how much we raised in the new term.</p>

        <p id="quiz-and-curry">Date for your diary - Quiz and curry night on Saturday 26 September at the
        school. Tickets will be available as soon as we come back to school.</p>

        <p>Lastly, thank you to everyone who has supported the PTA this year in anyway. This year we have provided a
        wide variety of items for the school including art easels, parasols, outdoor play tables, contribution towards
        the pantomime trip as well as giving each teacher an amount to spend on their class. Without your support we
        wouldn't be able to fund these. Please look out for the date of the AGM early in the Autumn term, we are always
        looking for new members.</p>
