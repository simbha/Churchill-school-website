        <h1>Newsletter - 7th October 2009</h1>

        <p>For those of you who could not join us for Harvest Lunch I would like to share with you the first verse of
        our Harvest Prayer:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>At harvest time, with grateful hearts<br/>
          We bring our offerings to you.<br/>
          We’re mindful of those people, Lord,<br/>
          Whose blessings are so few.<br/></p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Harvest</h2>

        <p>Special thanks to Alvis’ for supplying the cheese, the cooks in the kitchen for cooking the food, Kitchen
        Club for making the crumble topping, Aspens the caterers for donating food and all the staff for helping the
        make the lunch a great success from the apple cookers to the soup servers!</p>

        <h2>A special note from Class 4 and everyone in school</h2>

        <p>Thank you to St Mary’s for letting us celebrate Harvest in the Church.  We all enjoyed the wonderful music
        and poetry very much.  Thank you to all the Mums and Dads and friends who joined in our Service and helped us in
        our preparations in school.  We harvested food and baked delicious bread and crumbles.  Thank you also to
        everyone who helped to prepare our harvest lunch and to all who came to share the special occasion.</p>

        <h2>Sponsor a Spud</h2>

        <p>So far we have raised £78.40 in our Sponsor a Spud fund-raiser.  If you have not returned your sponsor money
        yet, there is still time to do so!</p>

        <h2>School Council</h2>
        <p><em>Written by Elise and Matthew – Year 6 School Councillors</em></p>

        <p>In our first School Council meeting, we talked about marking.  All of us agreed that we wanted teachers to
        use highlighters to mark our work.  We came up with the idea of stamps.  Mrs Tighe agreed, because she reminded
        us that teachers use up a lot of their time by writing comments in our books.</p>

        <p>We then discussed the new Year 6 teacher, as Ms Joskey is leaving in January.  We all decided that he or she
        must be kind, but still get lessons covered.  We would like a sporty teacher that doesn’t shout a lot.</p>

        <p>Next, Mrs Tighe introduced us to A.O.B. (Any Other Business).  Year 6 said they would like to read more
        stories that we write ourselves.  Year 4 wanted something done about the litter on the playground.</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>

        <p>Players of the week were:  Be Hughes and Steven Jones – well done!</p>

        <h2>Calling All Knitters!</h2>

        <p>Mrs Pain has done some beautiful embroidery with the children in school and her next project is knitted
        winter blankets.</p>

        <p>Have you got good knitting skills that you can share with us? We are seeking parents to work with Mrs Pain to
        help to teach the children to knit.  Please could you call into the school office if you are able to help.</p>
								
        <h2>Service Theme</h2>

        <p>Our Service theme this week is “Special Books”.</p>

        <h2>Back Entrance to School</h2>

        <p>The rear gate which leads onto the school playing field will be closed each day at 3.45 p.m.  If your child
        attends a club they will need to leave through the black gate at the front of the school in the KS1 playground.
        Unfortunately we have had to make this decision because of older children who do not attend Churchill Primary,
        entering the playing field after the school day has finished and riding around on their bikes.</p>

        <h2 id="ptaagm">PTA A.G.M.</h2>

        <p>Looking forward to seeing everyone at the PTA A.G.M. is on Tuesday 13th October starting at 8.00 p.m.  It
        will be a lovely informal opportunity to learn more about the work of the P.T.A. and the wonderful things they
        do in our school.</p>

        <h2 id="yr1teaat3">Advanced Notice –Tea at Three</h2>

        <p>Our next Tea at Three Event will be on Friday 16th October and will be hosted by Year 1.  Please come along
        and enjoy a cup of tea or coffee and tuck into some delicious cakes and biscuits.  All funds raised will benefit
        every child in school.</p>
