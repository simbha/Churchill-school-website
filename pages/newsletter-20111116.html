        <h1>Newsletter - 16th November 2011</h1>

        <h2>Governor vacancy</h2>

        <p>Last term we sent out information inviting a parent to join our governing body. We have
        had no responses! So if you missed the letter and think school governorship is for you
        please drop into the office.</p>

        <h2>School worship</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week is about bullying. What is bullying, what can be done about
        bullying and children’s own responsibilities? Each class will also be taking part in a
        special informative education session on the Life Bus that will be visiting school next week
        on the <strong>23rd</strong> and <strong>24th</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Governors profile – Nick Hobson, Parent Governor</h2>

        <blockquote><p>I was appointed as a parent governor in September 2009 when my eldest son
        started at the school. We have lived in the area long enough to remember watching the new
        school being built, my wife is a Deputy Head Teacher at another North Somerset school which
        has helped with the transition to being a governor as I was already familiar with some of
        the terminology and abbreviations used in education.</p>

        <p>I work for a large logistics company which involves a lot of driving but does also offer
        some flexibility which has enabled me to be involved at Churchill during the school day,
        mainly in recruitment as I am currently on the Personnel Committee.</p>

        <p>When I get the time I enjoy mountain biking with some of the other dads at the school –
        with so many great trails on the doorstop why not come along and join us!</p></blockquote>

        also running a sweet shop after school where sweets will be on sale! All profits to Children
