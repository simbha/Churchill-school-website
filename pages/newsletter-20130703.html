        <h2>Sports Day &amp; Picnic </h2>

        <p>Last Thursday was our Sports Day! We had a fantastic time in the morning taking part in
        different fun field events in our colour teams. <strong>Mrs. Rowtcliff</strong> was very
        impressed with the team work, encouragement and enthusiasm shown by all of the children. It
        was lovely to see so many parents and families enjoying the sunshine for our
        picnic. Congratulations to the green team for winning our competitive afternoon of sports
        and a big thank you to all those who helped to make the day so special!</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> Trip To Folly Farm</h2>

        <p><strong>Melody</strong>, <strong>Evelinh</strong> and <strong>Isobel</strong> said</p>

        <blockquote><p>“Folly Farm was very exciting, all the activities were very enjoyable. We
        especially enjoyed the den making, badger watching and the pond dipping. The food was the
        best, especially the chocolate brownies. The beds were very comfy and cosy. We did a lot of
        walking which was quite new for some of us and made us quite tired. We liked all the staff
        who made the trip a success and would like to thank <strong>Mrs. Lloyd</strong> for
        organising it all and <strong>Mrs. Humm</strong> for volunteering to stay the night and
        finally <strong>Mrs. Frost</strong> for giving up her time to stay in the
        day”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Skipping Workshops </h2>

        <p>Our skipping workshop last Friday was a great success. The children learned lots of
        fantastic skipping routines which they demonstrated to the whole school at the end of the
        day. We are now skipping our way to the end of term!</p>

        <h2>Rounders Competition</h2>

        <p>Well done to all who took part in the Cluster Rounders Festival. We had lots of fun and
        really improved our skills and team work as the games went on.</p>

        <h2>Cluster Sports Day </h2>

        <p>Yesterday was our Cluster Sports Day, where we were joined by six schools from the
        cluster to take part in lots of fun field and track events. Well done to everyone who took
        part and special congratulations to <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> for coming 2nd in
        their event. Thank you to all who helped out on the day and a special thank you to
        <strong>Claire Hooper</strong> for her Zumba warm-up sessions.</p>

        <h2>New Class Parents’ Evening</h2>

        <p>Don’t forget the parents’ evening to meet your child’s new teacher for the next academic
        year this <strong>Thursday 4th July</strong> – <strong>6.00pm</strong> for <span
        class="yeargroup">Years 1 &amp; 3</span>, <strong>6.30pm</strong> for <span

        <h2>Raffle Tickets</h2>

        <p>Very many thanks for all the sold raffle tickets so far. If you would like some more
        please come to the office where we have some extras.</p>

        <h2>Open Afternoon</h2>

        <p>Next <strong>Tuesday, 9th July</strong> from <strong>2.00pm</strong> we will be holding
        an open afternoon. This is a chance for you to wander around our school in an informal way
        to see what our pupils do during part of their day. Tea/coffee will be available in the
        library.</p>

        <h2>Spelling Support Pack</h2>

        <p>In response to the suggestions made by those parents who joined us on our Spelling and
        Reading evening back in April, we have put together a small pack of bits and pieces that we
        hope will help you to support your child’s spelling and reading. The pack includes phonics
        pronunciations/actions, common spelling rules, paragraphs to encourage children to ask
        questions and make connections and a set of thought bubbles that you can use with your child
        to stimulate discussion about what they have read. If you would like a pack please complete
        and return the slip at the end of the paper version of this newsletter, to the office, by
        <strong>Monday, 8th July 2013</strong>.</p>

        <p>We have also purchased a number of <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> Spelling Support
        booklets that set out the various spelling rules and strategies that your child will meet
        throughout <span class="yeargroup">years 3, 4, 5 and 6</span>. These are available from the
        office at a small cost of <strong>£1.25</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Class Swap</h2>

        <p>This <strong>Thursday afternoon</strong> the children will have the opportunity to spend
        some time in their new classes for September 2013.</p>

        <h2>Next Week Watch Out For…</h2>

        <p>A report on Kitchen Club Tea Party and an update on the latest HMI visit.</p>

        <h2>The Giving Machine – Shop Online &amp; Raise Funds For Our School </h2>

        <p>You can generate free cash donations for the school every time you shop online via The
        Giving Machine.  More than 400 retailers subscribe to this, including Amazon, M&amp;S, eBay,
        Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Next, John Lewis and Argos.  It will not cost you anything extra - the
        online shop pays a donation to the school on your behalf. At the moment we only have 2
        active givers but have still received a quarterly payment of £30… imagine how much more we
        could raise if more people joined!  Just go to <a
        href="http://www.TheGivingMachine.co.uk">www.TheGivingMachine.co.uk</a> to join as a
        shopper/giver and search for “Churchill Primary School PTA”.  Thank you.</p>
