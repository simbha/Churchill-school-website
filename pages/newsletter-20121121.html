        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for this week is about advent leading up to Christmas and we will be stirring
        up! Why not join us for service and pudding making on <strong>Monday morning</strong>.</p>

        <h2>OfSTED Report</h2>

        <p>After reading the report one of our mums commented on the life at school as being a
        ‘bubble of happiness’. If you would like to read the full report, which gives considerably
        more information, please go to <a
        href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/109215">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>.</p>

        <p>Don’t forget <strong>this Friday</strong> <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> will be
        hosting T@3. A chance to have a cuppa and catch up any news and swap flood stories!</p>

        <div id="books">
        <h2>Book Fair 2012!</h2>

        <p>This year’s annual Travelling Book fair will arrive in school tomorrow providing a great
        opportunity to stock up for Christmas!  The fair will run every day after school in the hall
        from <strong>this Friday</strong> until <strong>Wednesday 28th November</strong>.  We will
        also be offering an early morning opening slot <strong>this Friday</strong> between
        <strong>8.55am</strong> and <strong>9.15am</strong> where you can come and browse, children
        free!</p>

        <h2>Green Day</h2>

        <p>Wear something green on <strong>Friday, 30th November</strong> in celebration of Official
        Tree Planting Week. This will be a special day planting trees led by
        <strong>Mrs. Johns</strong> who is our local tree warden. Shoes may get muddy so you may
        like to send in some wellingtons.</p>

        <h2>Children In Need</h2>

        <p>Thanks to your spotty faces, sweatshirts, socks and scarves we raised
        <strong>£175.67</strong> for Children in Need. Well done everyone!</p>

        <h2>Anti-Bullying Week</h2>

        <p>Last week we joined thousands of children across the country to help raise awareness of
        the impact of bullying.  In our classes we discussed, drew and debated what bullies look
        like, how it feels to be bullied and what we can do to stop bullying.  The choir sang and
        danced “Raise My Voice”, an upbeat song with a positive message. The children enjoyed
        watching them so much they have been invited to teach the dance moves to <span
        class="yeargroup">KS1</span>.</p>

        <h2>After School Club</h2>

        <p>Week beginning <strong>Monday, 26th November</strong> is the LAST week for our teacher
        led clubs. EXCEPT kitchen club, we will meet on <strong>27th November</strong> and
