   <h2>Harvest</h2>

   <p>Thank you to so many people who made our harvest celebrations outstanding from the arrangement
   in the church, beautiful flowers, crunchy veg, donations, enthusiasm, great lunch and so much
   more!! The Children’s Hospice came to our service on Friday and were truly grateful for the food
   donations. <strong>Mrs. Beadle</strong> is totting up the ‘pounds’ from the lunch and 50% will be
   sent to the hospice the other 50% will be sent to Woodford to buy seeds for their garden as they
   come into their Spring/Summer now.</p>

   wrote:</p>

   <blockquote><p>“As I walked into the playground carrying a bag of apples I could see lots of
   fruit and vegetables as well as tin cans and packets of food in people’s
   bags. <strong>Danielle</strong> was carrying a can of peas and one of peeled tomatoes. We were
   both excited to be going to the church. When we got to the church the table of food was full and
   looked very colourful. We started singing our favourite song The Harvest Samba and the service
   went really quickly. For Harvest lunch the soup was really yummy and the crumble scrumptious. I
   had lots of custard on mine. It was my first Harvest at Churchill and I really enjoyed
   it. <strong>Jack</strong> said it was one of his best ones too”.</p></blockquote>

   <h2>Governors meeting</h2>

   <p>Last night was the first Governors meeting of the year. <strong>Sally Furness</strong> was
   elected Chair and <strong>John Votaw</strong> and <strong>Lorna Vickery</strong> as her Vice
   Chairs. We are currently looking for one parent governor – watch out for more information later
   this week.  </p>

   <p>Governors discussed the new School Improvement Plan (SIP) and learned more about how it will
   help your child achieve high standards and have happy lives at school. The three main strands are
   Creative Curriculum / Attainment &amp; Assessment / Community &amp; Church.</p>

   <p>Governors are looking forward to a busy year full of hard work, laughter and progress.</p>

   <h2>Governors profile – Mrs. Jackie Bush (Curriculum Committee)</h2>

   <p>I have been a governor since 2001. As well as having five children of my own, I have been a
   foster carer for 25 years and am involved with the training of new carers. My first child came to
   Churchill Primary in 1993. I am a member of the curriculum committee and have special
   responsibility for special educational needs (SEN) and child protection. I am currently Chair of
   the Parish Council and served on the Council since 1997. I grew up in the village and attended
   local schools. My roles as a school governor and as a parish councillor demand energy and
   commitment, however they allow me to play an active role at the heart of the community.</p>

   <h2>Netball club</h2>

   <p>Is back to the normal day of <strong>Monday</strong> next week.</p>

   <h2>Cycle helmets</h2>

   <p>It would be a good idea if children riding their bikes to school wore a helmet. </p>

   <h2>Parking</h2>

   <p>Please could you be mindful of surrounding neighbours and the safety of our children when
   parking your car in or around school. The Highway Code Rule 243 informs us that we should not
   park opposite or within 10 metres (32 feet) of a junction.</p>

   <h2>Blagdon Guides</h2>

   <p>Blagdon Guides are holding a cake sale in the school playground this
   <strong>Friday</strong>. They are raising funds for the Girl Guides Association Lodge being built
   in Summermead, Wedmore.  </p>

   <h2>Christingle</h2>

   <p>The Christingle service this year will be held on <strong>Wednesday 30th
   November</strong>.</p>

   <h2>Lollies for Africa</h2>

   <p><strong>Jack</strong>, <strong>Joseph</strong> and <strong>William</strong> would like to
   thank all those who bought ice lollies last Friday. All the proceeds are going towards their trip
   to South Africa in July 2012.</p>

   <h2>Sparklers</h2>

   <p>Celebrate harvest with Sparklers where they will be cooking, painting, singing and enjoying a
   story about Jesus. Have fun on <strong>Thursday, 6th October</strong> at St. Mary’s Church from
   <strong>10:00-11:30</strong>. All pre-school children welcome for more details contact
   <strong>Zoé</strong> on <strong>852606</strong> or <strong>Clare</strong> on

   <h2>Blagdon fire station</h2>

   <p>A car wash is being held at Blagdon Fire Station on <strong>Saturday, 15th October
   14:00-17:00</strong> to raise funds for the Fire Service.</p>

   <h2>Spca (Malaysia)</h2>

   <p><strong>Kosheila Sivabalan</strong> came into school to help raise funds for The Society for
   the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Malaysia. The funds are to neuter stray and abandoned
   animals, helping to rehome them and general medical support.</p>
