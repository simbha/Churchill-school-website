        <h1>Newsletter - 19th September 2012</h1>

        <h2>Harvest Time</h2>

        <p>We hope you will be able to walk with us to St. Mary’s Church leaving school at
        <strong>9.15am</strong> to celebrate this important time of year. We would encourage
        children to bring some produce with them tinned or fresh, on <strong>Thursday 27th
        September</strong>. This will then be taken to a local hospice.</p>

        <p><strong>Mrs. Beadle</strong> has been busy organising Harvest lunch numbers, timings and
        sittings — letter to follow. <strong>Miss Schroeder</strong> will be cooking a lovely
        chicken or vegetable stew using vegetables grown in the school garden. If you haven’t sent
        in your lunch request yet please don’t leave it any longer — please bring it in by this
        <strong>Thursday morning</strong> so we can finalise numbers. As there is a real shortage of
        apples this year can each child please <strong>bring an apple</strong> in on
        <strong>Monday</strong> to be used in the crumble.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week will be Harvest and the highlight of the week will be the walk to
        the Church on <strong>Thursday, 27th</strong> followed by our Harvest lunch.  </p>

        <h2>Open Afternoon</h2>

        <p>Don’t forget Tuesday, <strong>25th September</strong> is the day we will be opening our
        doors for the afternoon, from <strong>1.45pm</strong>. All are welcome to visit our school
        to see what goes in our classrooms. If you know of any parents with children starting school
        next September please let them know. </p>

        <h2>Clubs</h2>

        <p>Teacher led clubs start on <strong>Monday 24th</strong> and you should have received a
        letter regarding your child’s place. Please return the slip at the bottom of the letter to
        the office.</p>

        <p>Orchestra and creative writing on a <strong>Tuesday</strong> still have spaces. </p>

        <p>The choir are always looking for new members, why not sign your child up for this
        <strong>Monday</strong> club?</p>

        <h2>School Council</h2>

        <p>The new school year is well and truly under way and so are the elections for our new
        school councillors!  Those children wishing to stand for councillors will have been asked to
        address their classes, discussing why they think they’d make cracking councillors.  Once
        voted in, new councillors will be meeting with <strong>Mrs Grant</strong> later this week to
        plan the year ahead!  There are already lots of things bubbling on the back boiler! Look out
        for news of these, photographs and updates from the school council in and around the
        school. </p>

        <h2>Volunteers Needed!</h2>

        <p>Don’t forget this <strong>Saturday</strong> from <strong>10.00am</strong> we have a
        working party to help our new gardener sort out the overgrown garden – many hands make light
        work. Refreshments will be provided. For more information contact <strong>Claire
        Smith</strong> on <strong>01934 853320</strong> or <strong>07747632015</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Parents e-Safety Evening</h2>

        <p>Safety on the internet is becoming a hot topic in society and in schools. We are running
        an e-safety evening on <strong>Tuesday, 16th October</strong> at <strong>6.00pm</strong>. We
        will be available to give advice on how to stay safe online including cyberbullying both
        adults and children and how we are teaching e-safety here at Churchill Primary School. </p>

        <h2>Roald Dahl Day</h2>

        <blockquote><p>“I know exactly what words I am wanting to say, but somehow or other they is always
        getting squiff-squiddled around.” BFG.</p></blockquote>

        <p>It wasn’t just the BFG getting tongue tied in his 30th birthday last Thursday, we all
        loved experimenting with whizumptious words. From hipscuddles and gunzlebumkum to
        squiffscuddle and piffle swash — we created oodles of exciting new  vocabulary by joining
        prefixes and suffixes. Like the BFG we also collected ours dreams in a dream jar and learnt
        about big dreamers of the past. Some of us also met, drew and described Fleshumpeaters and
        Bonecrunchers! <strong>Matthew</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“The day was fun and we made dream jars and decorated them with patterns in
        different colours”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Kids Club AGM</h2>

        <p>Please support the Kids Club AGM on <strong>Wednesday 19th September</strong> at the
        Langford Inn from <strong>7.00pm</strong>. Find out more about before and after school
        provision provided on the school premises.</p>

        <h2>Sponsored P.E. Kit</h2>

        <p>We are looking for a willing sponsor to purchase P.E. kit for when we play fixtures with
        other schools. If you or your company are interested please speak with
        <strong>Mrs. Rowtcliff</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span>. We would like to
        wear your company’s logo with pride!!</p>

        <h2>Dinner Money</h2>

        <p>It would be very helpful for our busy office if dinner money could be brought into school
        in a named envelope. There have been several occasions of children losing their dinner money
        and then becoming extremely worried about this.</p>

        <h2>Michael Morpurgo</h2>

        <p>The Book People have a box set of 16 books by the popular author <strong>Michael
        Morpurgo</strong> for <strong>£15</strong> — a great start to your Christmas shopping! The
        school will also benefit by receiving 10% of all orders. If you are interested please come
        to the office for an order form.</p>

        <h2>School Library</h2>

        <p>Once again our school library will be open during lunchtimes, very kindly manned by our
        volunteer librarian <strong>Mrs Vernon</strong>. Why not come and have a browse at some of the new title on
        the shelves?</p>

        <h2>Churchill Pre-School AGM</h2>

        <p>Churchill Pre-School Committee is holding their AGM this <strong>Thursday, 20th
        September</strong> starting at <strong>8.00pm</strong> in Churchill Methodist Hall. Anyone
        interested in finding out more please come along.</p>

        and raffle in aid of the Tower Appeal on <strong>Friday, 5th October</strong> from
