        <h2>Out and About</h2>

        <p>Next week <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> will be spending the day following the course of the River
        Parrot; I'm looking forward to their report.</p>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> visited the Big Pit in Blaenavon Pontypool. Here is a short report from
        Harry Ford:-</p>

        <blockquote><p>"One day I went to school really excited about going to a place in Wales called the Big Pit...</p>

        <p>When we got out of the cage we walked through some doors called Pit Pony Doors because the miners used to open
        them for the Pit Ponies. Then we walked on, it was interesting because there were dates and signatures on the
        wall and there were two metal bars that rang a bell. I thought it was fun."</p></blockquote>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> will be enjoying a Sculpture Trip to Portishead Marina; looks like
        great fun.</p>

        <h2>New Parent Evenings</h2>

        <p>We understand that there may be some parents who will find it difficult to attend these. Each class team will
        be producing a short summary information sheet so that you don't miss out.</p>

        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>

        <p>Interesting fact of the week chosen by <strong>Charlotte Wilkinson</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year
