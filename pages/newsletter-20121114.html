        <h1>Newsletter - 14th November 2012</h1>

        <h2>Remembrance Day</h2>

        <p>We were all so proud of the children for the quiet respect that they showed during this
        special time last Friday. Thank you to <strong>Kate Sax</strong> for leading the service at
        St. Mary’s Church. We hope that the wreath made and placed by the children will be a
        reminder for them over the coming weeks of the importance of working together as a community
        to ensure peaceful lives, <strong>Cheryl Curley</strong> kindly cut the wreath base for
        us. Thank you also to <strong>Mr. Young</strong>, our caretaker, who shared some of his
        family war medals for bravery with the children.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for this week is about leaders and how people worship.</p>

        <h2>Wednesday 14th November – Kindness Day</h2>

        <p>It doesn’t take much to make someone smile. We have been encouraging the children to ‘do’
        at lease one kind deed today. Have you?</p>

        <h2>‘What A Hoot’ - Everybody Writes Day 2012</h2>

        <p>During the morning of <strong>Monday 22nd October</strong>, we were joined by <strong>Mr
        Jenkins</strong> and six of his feathery friends, including Spice the barn owl, Nyra the
        snowy owl and Bob the tawny owl!  We learnt so much about their habitats, their diet and
        their amazing adaptations!  Back in class we used our powerful persuasive skills to support
        Mr Jenkins in his appeal for a piece of land to set up a local owl sanctuary. We hope these
        letters and posters will help!</p>

        <h2>Children In Need</h2>

        <p>This <strong>Friday</strong> children can wear their school uniform and attach something
        spotty to it. We would like to cover the yellow line in the hall with your donations of
        <strong>50p</strong> or <strong>£1</strong>. <strong>Miss Schroeder</strong> and Kids Club
        will be making cupcakes for everyone.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> Trip To Bristol</h2>

        <p><strong>Lizzie</strong>, <strong>Isobel</strong> and <strong>Claudia</strong> wrote:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“On <strong>Monday, 12th November</strong> <span class="yeargroup">class
        5</span> went to the SS Great Britain. We learnt that SS stands for steam ship. We really
        enjoyed the tour around the SS Great Britain.” After this we went to see the stuffed animals
        and dinosaurs in Bristol museum.”</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Christmas Fayre PTA Meeting</h2>

        <p>All parents welcome on <strong>Monday, 19th November 7.30pm</strong> here at school.</p>

        <h2>Rotary Club Youth Speaks Competition</h2>

        <p>Three children in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span>, <strong>Emily Hurst</strong>,
        <strong>William Pearce</strong> and <strong>Archie Alexander</strong> are very busy
        preparing speeches for this year’s competition which will take place at Shipham Village Hall
        on <strong>Friday, 23rd November</strong>. We wish them luck and look forward to hearing all
        about it.</p>

        <h2>Anti-Bullying Week</h2>

        <p>This week each class has been thinking about ways to prevent bullying. In our Friday
        service we shared our ideas through songs, poetry and posters.</p>

        <h2>Absences </h2>

        <p>During October there were 125 sessions missed because of holidays. Four children had at
        least twenty sessions out. This means children’s education is being disrupted and it may
        impact on the progress they make.</p>

        <h2>Road Safety Day</h2>

        <p>Next <strong>Thursday, 22nd</strong>, is Road Safety Day so our theme is ‘Wear Something
        BRIGHT at NIGHT’. In Tuesday’s service we will find out about ways to keep cyclists and
        pedestrians safe at night. There is also a competition to design a poster to persuade people
        to ‘Wear Something Bright at Night’. A prize for the best posters for <span
        class="yeargroup">Reception</span>, <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> and <span
        class="yeargroup">KS2</span>. Bring in your entries by next <strong>Thursday 22nd</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Music Lessons</h2>

        <p>If you are already in receipt of music lessons at school a booking letter for the next
        term will be sent to you this week. If you would like your child to <strong>start</strong> lessons from
        <strong>January 2013</strong> please pick up a letter from the office. All booking forms must be sent back by
        <strong>Friday, 23rd November</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Green Day</h2>

        <p>Wear something green, all green, part green or just a tiny bit of green (you choose) on
        <strong>Friday, 30th November</strong> in celebration of Official Tree Planting Week. This
        will be a special day planting trees led by <strong>Mrs. Johns</strong> who is our local
        tree warden.</p>

        <h2>Collision</h2>

        <p>Unfortunately one of our parents has had significant damage done to the back of her
        vehicle whilst parked in Rowan Way. Although there must have been damage to the other
        vehicle nobody has claimed responsibility as yet. If you have seen anything can you please
        call into the office. Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Christmas Cakes To Order</h2>

        <p>One of our parents will be making Christmas cakes to order. The staff have eaten samples
