        <h1>Newsletter - 3rd October 2012</h1>

        <p>Thank you to the huge numbers of people who supported our harvest fundraising event. So
        many people helped to make the day successful from <strong>Libby</strong> and <strong>John
        Cook</strong> opening the church at <strong>8.30am</strong> so that we could go in and
        arrange our rustic flowers which had been picked by willing hands the night before — to
        <strong>Mrs. Lloyd</strong> who delivered the goods to the hospice on
        <strong>Friday</strong> after school. Over <strong>£400</strong> was raised. Thank you to
        <strong>Mrs. Williams</strong> for running the raffle of two beautiful boxes of fruit &amp;
        veg that had been donated. The staff, parents, governors and helpers did a fantastic job to
        ensure everyone was fed and enjoyed <strong>Miss Schroeder’s</strong> cooking at its
        best. </p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week will be about ‘belonging’.</p>

        <h2>Woodford Primary School – South Africa</h2>

        <p>This week we had an email from Woodford School thanking us for blankets and jumpers we
        have recently sent. They will use the money we send to buy seeds for their school garden and
        toys and games for their reception class of 96 children.</p>

        <h2>Considerate Parking Please</h2>

        <p>As there are traffic lights outside school please be more mindful of parking in and
        around the area. A number of children are still being dropped off inappropriately, please
        consider the safety of the children above all else.</p>

        <h2>Card Collectors</h2>

        <p>Please keep your card collections at home (including Moshi Monsters) as they may get lost
        or damaged in school. Thank you.</p>
