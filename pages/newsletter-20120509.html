        <h2>Olympic Torch Competition</h2>

        <p>We are looking forward to seeing the torches you have made with your children. Please
        bring them into school on <strong>18th May</strong>. All torches will join the parade, with one being chosen
        as the winner (by the school council) and leading us through the streets of Langford on <strong>23rd
        May</strong>.</p>

        <h2>National No Socks Day</h2>

        <p>What a wonderful array of socks were “worn” today, from Peru to homemade dragon
        faces. Thank you for the donations you made – a total of <strong>£30</strong> will be sent to Woodford
        Primary School in South Africa so that the staff can buy socks for the children to wear in
        the coming winter months.</p>

        <div id="wts">
        <h2>Walk To School Week</h2>

        <p>Don’t forget next week is Walk to School Week. Choose any way to come to school except
        motorised transport for the whole week! You can park in the Stag and Hounds pub and walk
        through to the back gate. Daily tallies will be taken during registration apart from
        <strong>Wednesday</strong> when there will be staff at the two gates. A prize draw for those
        children who walk, or otherwise, all week will be held on <strong>Friday</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>National Teachers Day</h2>

        <p>We are very lucky to have such hard working teaching staff who go the extra mile for our
        children. Last week the children picked new names for our teachers using alliteration. The
        children had lots of fun. Why not ask them what they came up with?</p>

        <h2>Jubilee Fair - Events</h2>

        <p>The forthcoming Jubilee Fair promises to be a fun packed day. Some of the events taking
        place include Zumba, Morris dancing, children and ladies’ Maypole dancing, tug-o-war,
        worship and wheelbarrow racing. Cadbury Saxophone Band will also be playing throughout the
        day. If anyone would like to be involved in any way with the event contact <strong>Lesley
        Hegarty</strong> on <strong>01934 852678</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Jubilee Quiz – Win £25!</h2>

        <p>The Village Fund committee are running a quiz as part of the celebrations in the run up
        to the Jubilee Fair. Quiz sheets are available at Churchill Post Office, the school office
        and the playground for <strong>£1</strong> and can be returned to these places. First prize
        is <strong>£25</strong> and the winner will be announced on <strong>Sunday, 3rd
        June</strong> at the Jubilee Fair.</p>

        <div id="disco">
        <h2>PTA Disco</h2>

        <p>The PTA is running another very popular children’s disco on <strong>Thursday, 31st
        May</strong>. They have had plenty of offers to help with the <span
        class="yeargroup">KS1</span> disco but are struggling with the <span
        class="yeargroup">KS2</span> disco. If you are able to help please let a member of the PTA
        or the office know as soon as possible. If they don’t get enough offers of help the <span
        class="yeargroup">KS2</span> disco will not go ahead.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>A Child’s View Of Lunchtimes</h2>

        <p><strong>Oliver</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span> said that the school has
        lots of equipment to play on and we have really helpful lunchtime
        assistants. <strong>Matthew</strong>, also in <span class="yeargroup">Year 5</span>, said
        that there was a lot of space to run around in and he likes the freedom to do so.</p>

        <h2>…Could Do Better</h2>

        <p>There were several requests for more trips and visits for children. When we have our
        Planning Inset day in July staff will review this area of the curriculum. We will also be
        sharing ideas of how to take advantage of our local area as we endeavour to keep costs
        down. Watch out in September for the development of this area.</p>

        <h2>What We Do Well – A Parent’s Quote</h2>

        <p>This week the quote from one of our parents was that older children know their child’s
        name, mutual respect, ‘smallness’ of school, day trips and people brought into school,
        teachers' dedication and commitment to their child.</p>

        <h2>PTA Band In The Barn</h2>

        <p>Don’t forget your tickets for the PTA event ‘Band in the Barn’ featuring the ‘Skinny
        Dippers’ on <strong>Friday, 25th May</strong>. Please see your class rep, PTA or call into
        the office. Tickets are <strong>£10</strong> which includes a BBQ. This promises to be a really good
