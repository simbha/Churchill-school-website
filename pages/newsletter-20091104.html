        <h1>Newsletter - 4th November 2009</h1>
        
        <p>As the wet and windy winter weather arrives, children frequently have to spend part of lunchtimes in their
        classrooms, between the showers. We have a shortage of board games and small toys e.g. cars and blocks etc. so
        if you have any used ones you would like to donate, we would be very grateful. Thank you in advance!</p>

        <h2>Use of the Internet</h2>
        <p>Children frequently use the Internet to support their school work and during wet playtimes. In Key Stage 1,
        children only have access to Education City during playtime. In Key Stage 2, children have access to a number of
        sites and often play games, etc. Our Internet is protected by the South West Grid for Learning (SWGL), which
        blocks unsuitable sites.</p>

        <p>During a recent survey, we were surprised at the large number of children who use the Internet unsupervised
        at home.</p>

        <h2>Poppy Appeal</h2>

        <p>We now have poppies in school to raise money for the Royal British Legion. Please contribute as much as you
        can for this very special cause and your child will get a poppy in return! We will be holding a service in
        school to observe a minutes silence and explain the reasons for this special day to the children.</p>

        <h2>School Dinners</h2>

        <p>The price of a school meal remains at £1.95 per day (£9.75 per week). If you wish to pay in advance until the
        end of term (18th December), the amount required is £68.25. Please make cheques payable to "North Somerset
        Council".</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>
        
        <p>Football players of the week were: Jacob Webber and Max Pearson - well done to both of them!</p>

        <h2 id="firstclass">"First Class" Photographs</h2>

        <p>A full colour supplement "First Class" will be appearing in the Weston Mercury on Thursday November
        5th where you will find a photograph of our current Reception Class. Be sure to buy a copy for a
        keepsake! Copies of the photograph can be purchased either via their website: www.westonmercury.co.uk and
        selecting "buy and sell" from the left hand side menu or by telephone - 01934 422522.</p>

        <h2 id="cyclesheds">Wheels to School</h2>

        <p>Our cycle shed which is part of our North Somerset Travel Plan work is now almost completed and we are
        looking forward to being able to use it soon. The Grand Opening will be on Monday 16th November and during the
        rest of this week we have asked the Police to come in and talk to the children about cycling safely and they
        will be available to security mark bikes. More details to follow.</p>

        <p>Thank you to Mrs Lloyd for all her hard work in leading the Travel Plan and bringing this project to a
        successful conclusion.</p>

        <h2>Service Theme</h2>

        <p>Next week the children will be learning about other world faiths.</p>

        <h2 id="photos">Photographs</h2>

        <p>Tomorrow (5th November) is school photograph day, when the children will all be individually photographed and
        also with siblings. The photographer will be here from 8.30&nbsp;a.m. if you would like younger children who are not
        in school yet included in a family picture.</p>
