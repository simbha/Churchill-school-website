        are inviting all children to design a special hat. It could be a hat to suit their
        personality or hobbies. It could be a ‘mad’ hat or a beautiful hat. Get creative with your
        designs and have fun. Bring in your designs to your class teacher by <strong>Thursday, 19th
        January</strong>. On <strong>Friday, 20th</strong> we will have a special Hat Day service
