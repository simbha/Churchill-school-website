	<h1>Newsletter - 8th December 2010</h1>

	<h2>Correction</h2>

	<p>We return to school on <strong>Tuesday 4th December</strong>, not Monday as stated in last
	week’s newsletter.</p>

	<h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> Christmas party</h2>

	<p>This will be on <strong>Thursday 16th December</strong> and there is a list of party
	foods to offer to bring on the classroom doors. Please note this is a change of date.</p>

	<h2>Christmas postbox</h2>

	<p><span class="yeargroup">Year R</span> and <span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> are the
	Churchill Christmas Post Delivery Service. Please encourage your children to send Christmas
	cards via the post box in the entrance hall. The box is emptied once a day.  Please make
	sure the child’s name and class is on the envelope.</p>

	<h2>Our visit to the pantomime</h2>

	<p>Last Friday we went on an exciting trip to the Blakehay Theatre. We watched the pantomime
	Jack and the Beanstalk. My favourite character was Simple Simon because he was funny and
	made us shout “Hi, Si, your tree's gone dry!” Then he watered a plant and it grew.</p>

	<p>The funniest and loudest part was when the ghosts came as the characters were singing. We
	all had to shout “Ghost!”.</p>

	<p>We are sure that everyone in the school enjoyed it including the staff and especially
	us.</p>

	<p><em>By <strong>Phoebe Samuel</strong> and <strong>Lucy Slingsby</strong> in <span
	class="yeargroup">Year 5</span>.</em></p>

	<h2>Christmas fair</h2>

	<p>A big thank you to helpers, buyers, tea sippers, cake eaters, gift bringers, organisers,
	cleaner uppers, face painters, stage movers, dishwashers, cake makers, smiling faces,
	decorators, tidy uppers, bacon cookers, stall holders, gift givers and everyone else who
	came to the Christmas Fair.</p>

	<h2>The roundabout table</h2>

	<p>This table in the entrance hall is changed each week and encourages children to think
	about questions, identify strange objects and make them smile. Thank you to
	<strong>Erin</strong> and <strong>Sam</strong> from <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span>
	who had a mystery feely box competition which was very popular.</p>

	<p>This week <strong>Connie Rawlins</strong>, <strong>Mia Sanfilippo</strong> and
	<strong>Megan Paterson</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> have decorated a
	beautiful roundabout table with a Christmas theme.</p>

	<h2>What to do if the weather is bad!</h2>

	<p>If there are huge amounts of snow and you think the school may be closed please look on
	the school website:</p>

	school open whatever the weather.</p>

	18:30</strong> at <strong>St. John’s Church</strong>. If you would like to do a reading please come and see

	<h2>Fact of the week</h2>

	<p>This week the fact has been chosen by <strong>Vinny Giles</strong> in <span
	class="yeargroup">Year 2</span></p>

	<blockquote><p>“Since Hindus don’t eat beef the McDonald’s in New Delhi makes its burgers
	from sheep”!</p></blockquote>

	<h2>Parents working party</h2>

	<p>Thank you to all the people who responded to the recent questionnaire. The group will be
	meeting before the end of term and will feed back information to you in the new year.</p>

	<h2>Celebrations of the week</h2>

	<p>This week we didn’t give out certificates because of the Panto visit but special
	footballers were <strong>Dylan Yandell</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> and
	<strong>Steven Jones</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span>.</p>

	<h2>Win a bike for Christmas</h2>

	<p>We have had a brand new, shiny child’s bike donated and will be selling raffle tickets in
	the playground before and after school. The bike will be in the playground for viewing. The
	draw will take place at the Carol Service on the last day of term and we will come and find
	the winner in case you wish it to be a surprise!</p>

	<h2>Mrs Tighe's thought for the day</h2>

	<p>We have such fantastic, caring and thoughtful children I feel it is a real privilege to
	be the Head of this school.</p>
