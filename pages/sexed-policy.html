	<h1>Draft Relationships and Sex Education Policy</h1>

	<p>This policy reflects the Church of England foundation and ethos of the school (and has
	been formally adopted by the Governing Body and staff).</p>

	<h2>Rationale</h2>

	<p>Sex Education is incorporated into the PHSE and Science Schemes of Work and takes into
	account the age and maturity of the children.</p>

	<h2>Aims</h2>

	<ul>

	  <li>To help the children begin to understand the functioning of their own bodies and those
	  of the opposite sex within the context of caring relationships.</li>

	  <li>To give children the opportunity to discuss relevant sensitive issues in an atmosphere
	  where trust prevails between pupils and staff.</li>

	  <li>Relationships and sex education is taught throughout the school with a greater
	  emphasis on sex education and puberty in years 5 and 6.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Content</h2>

	<ul>

	  <li>Increases consideration for others and responsibility through caring
	  relationships.</li>

	  <li>Provides correct information about the human body.</li>

	  <li>Develops an acceptable vocabulary for talking about the human body at home and in
	  school.</li>

	  <li>Fosters sensible attitudes to body function and cleanliness.</li>

	  <li>Builds on attitudes and understanding and includes moral considerations.</li>

	  <li>Increases sensitivity and tolerance to different types of home backgrounds, whilst
	  taking into account the school’s Church foundation.</li>

	  <li>Develops ideas of non-stereotyped gender role.</li>

	  <li>Studies growth and development</li>

	  <li>Provides opportunities for children to understand and cope with “personal safety” and
	  “appropriate touch”.</li>

	  <li>Prepares for puberty changes – physical, social and emotional.</li>

	  <li>For most of Year 5 and all of Year 6 pupils will change separately for P.E. to allow
	  for adolescent changes.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Parents are encouraged to view material used and have the right to withdraw their
	children from all or part of Relationships and Sex Education provided by the school, except
	for those parts included in the Statutory National Curriculum.</p>
