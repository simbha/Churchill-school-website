        <h1>Newsletter - 18th November 2009</h1>

        <p>The children enjoyed the grand opening of the bike shed on Monday and we look forward to seeing 
them cycling to school, wearing their helmets!  Tuesday saw the introduction of our Anti-bullying 
Week and all classes are working  to help stamp out bullying.</p>

<h2>Mr Anderson</h2>

<p>Thank you to all of the people who have offered help and support during Mr Anderson's 
forthcoming time off.  Miss Pow and Mrs Miell will be joining the SMSA team on Tuesdays and 
Fridays.  Mrs Churchill will be taking on some of Mr Anderson's jobs and the cleaning company 
will be increasing their hours to ensure our school is always clean and ready.  Kid's Club and Miss 
Schroeder will be taking over care of Norman, but  we are still looking for a volunteer to look after 
the fish. It has been heart warming to have such positive support from everyone - thank you!</p>

<h2 id="choir">Choir</h2>

<p>Please note that there will be no Choir on Friday of this week (20th November) as Ms Joskey is on a 
course  The club will resume as usual next week.</p>

<h2>Collecting Your Child After School</h2>

<p>As parents are aware, school finishes at 3.30 p.m.  If you are going to be late in collecting your 
child from school, please telephone and let us know and your child will wait in the Library for you 
to arrive.  Please may we remind you that Kid's Club is available for parents to use for before and 
after school care.  Please call 07756 355628 for further details.</p>

        <h2 id="ChristmasDinner">Christmas Dinner</h2>

<p>Please remember to return your slips promptly to order a school Christmas Dinner for you and your 
child (children £1.95 adults £2.30).</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>

        <p>Players of the week were:  James Ford and Tia Collard - well done!</p>

        <h2>Service Theme</h2>

        <p>Our Service theme this week is "Stir Up Sunday" -  making celebration food for Christmas.</p>

       <h2>Staff Changes</h2>
	   
	   <p>Sadly Miss Dyke will be leaving at the end of this term.  She has given the children in her care a 
wonderful start to Year 5.  She has decided to take a post in industry and will be leaving teaching.  
We are currently recruiting for her replacement.

Mrs Grant  will be joining us in January as Deputy Head and Year 6 teacher.  She will be visiting 
the school before Christmas to meet and get to know the children and to liaise with Mrs 
Hetherington and Ms Joskey.  We look forward to her joining our team.</p>
	   
	   <h2>Morrisons Vouchers - Final Plea</h2>
<p>Please dig through your bags, drawers/cupboards for any stray Morrison's Vouchers and bring them 
into school!  The more we can collect the more equipment we can order.  Thank you for all your 
support so far!</p>
	   
	   <h2 id="craftfair">Churchill Community School Craft Fair</h2>

<p>Looking for a few unusual items for Christmas presents?  You may find them at Churchill 
Community School's Craft Fair on Saturday 21st November, from 11.00 a.m. until 3 p.m.  Please 
take time to support this event if you are available.</p>

<h2>Whole School Pantomime Visit</h2>

<p>Please do not forget to send in the permission slip for our wonderful pantomime visit, together with 
£4.00 per child, by the end of this week.  Mrs Strawbridge has more forms if you cannot find yours!</p>

<h2 id="mufti">Children In Need</h2>

<p>Just to remind you that next Friday (20th November) will be a Mufti Day where children may wear 
non-school uniform.  They should wear something "spotty" and will have the opportunity to enjoy 1 
Pudsey treat baked by the Year 1 children at a cost of 50p.  If your child does not want a Pudsey 
treat, then a donation towards the charity would be greatly appreciated.  

With thanks - Mrs S. Strawbridge KS1 Co-ordinator.</p>
