        <h1>Newsletter - 6th February 2013</h1>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The first assembly back will be about courage and this will include the story of Daniel
        and the lion. Many things in life take courage and children will be encouraged to see how
        this story is still important today.</p>

        <h2>Certificates</h2>

        <p>Very well done to everyone who received a certificate last week.</p>

        <strong>Kylan Green</strong> (<span class="yeargroup">Y6</span>) for being the footballers
        of the week.</p>

        <h2>Heart Foundation</h2>

        <p>A total of <strong>£82.09</strong> was raised last week. Every penny raised will help in
        the fight against heart and circulatory disease. Some of the ways the money is used for this
        vital work is buying assay kits, supplying nurses, scientists and even funding teenagers on
        a weekend of support and confidence building. Thank you for your support.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> Phonics Workshop</h2>

        <p>Thank you to all the parents that attended the phonics workshop, especially Reception
        class parents. The feedback received was that it had been very useful workshop. There are
        guidebooks available in each <span class="yeargroup">KS1</span> class for anyone that was
        unable to attend. If any <span class="yeargroup">KS2</span> parents would like a copy please
        see <strong>Miss Roberts</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Maths Countdown – Thursday 7th February 7.00pm</h2>

        <p>Have you ever worried about helping your children with their maths? Then this evening is
        for you. We will begin in the hall with an introduction about maths teaching across the
        school. We will then rotate around the classrooms learning about a different maths operation
        in each room. By the end of the evening we will all know how
        addition/subtraction/multiplication/division are taught across the school.</p>

        <h2>Pancake Day</h2>

        <p>On <strong>Thursday, 7th February</strong> we will be making pancakes in school to
        celebrate Shrove Tuesday, marking the beginning of Lent. <span class="yeargroup">Year 5 and
        6</span> will be sharing their Lent book, donated by our village churches, with all
        pupils. These books suggest ideas of what you can ‘do’ rather than give up for lent
        e.g. phone someone you love but haven’t seen for a while or have a TV/computer game-free day
        and do something different instead. We look forward to hearing what you did!</p>

        <h2>Swimming <span class="yeargroup">Years 3 &amp; 4</span></h2>

        <p>Just a reminder that <span class="yeargroup">Years 3 and 4</span> swimming will be on the
