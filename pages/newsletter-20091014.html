        <p>We now have new supplies of sweatshirts and book bags in school!</p>

        <h2>Morning Supervision</h2>

        <p>The school gates open each morning at 8.40 a.m. and the children are supervised from 8.45 a.m.  Please ensure
        that your children know that once they enter the school premises they must remain in the playground until the
        bell rings for them to line up.  Under no circumstances must they go out of the school gates again once they
        have arrived at school.</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>

        <p>Players of the week were:  Jack Slingsby and Josh Mees.  Well done!</p>

        <p>Our theme for this week is “Church of England Worship”.</p>


        <h2 id="tat3">Tea at Three</h2>

        <p>On Friday 16th October Class 1 will be hosting our “Tea at Three” in the school hall.  Please come along and
        have some delicious cakes and biscuits and a refreshing tea or coffee.  It is a great opportunity to meet other
        parents for some lively conversation in an informal setting!</p>

        <h2>PTA – A.G.M.</h2>

        <p>Thank you to the parents and staff who came to the PTA A.G.M. last night.  We are really pleased that the
        paired Chairs and the Committee are happy to continue leading the PTA team for another year.  Looking forward to
        the events that they organise and the fund-raising that the children benefit from.</p>


        <h2>Used School Uniform for Jolaurabi School, Kenya</h2>

        <p>Do you have any school uniform which your children have out-grown?  The children in Jolaurabi School in Kenya
        wear the same school uniform as us (girls: blue and white dresses and the boys: blue or white shirts and short
        grey trousers (it does not matter if the knees are worn or damaged on long trousers – they will be cut off).</p>

        <p>The S.C.A. Children’s Appeal charity provides free education through sponsorship for over 600 children aged
        between 3 and 16 years.  The children are provided with breakfast (a bowl of ugali – similar to porridge) since
        many arrive at school hungry.  Education in Kenya is seen as a privilege.  Children love to go to school and are
        proud to wear uniform.</p>

        <p>Please bring any items you wish to donate into school and we will pass this on to the charity organisers.</p>
