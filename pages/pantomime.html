        <h1>Pantomime Visit - Change of Date</h1>

        <p>Unfortunately, there has been a mistake with the booking of the Theatre, therefore we are fortunate to be
        going to the Blakehay Theatre this Friday (27th November, 2009).</p>

        <p>Children need to be in school for registration at 8.30 a.m.  Gates will be open at 8.20 a.m.</p>

        <p>Key Stage 2 children will need to bring a healthy snack and water in a named plastic bottle.</p>

        <p>Key Stage 1 will have fruit and water provided.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused!</p>

        <p>If you have any problems, please do pop in to see me.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your support.</p>

        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
        <p>Mrs S. Strawbridge, KS1 Co-ordinator</p>
