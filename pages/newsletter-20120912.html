        <h1>Newsletter - 12th September 2012</h1>

        <p>Autumn seems to be with us, so time to plan Harvest.</p>

        <p>Harvest lunch letters have already been sent out, so we look forward to seeing as many
        parents as possible on <strong>Thursday, 27th September</strong>. We will be inviting the
        children to bring in produce on <strong>27th</strong>. The highlight of our Harvest
        celebration will be our church service, we welcome parents to walk with us to St. Mary’s
        Church leaving school at <strong>9.15am</strong>. Please let the class teacher know if you
        are able to help.</p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>The theme for next week will be about the environment near and far including our school
        gardens and the world around us.</p>

        <h2>Open Afternoon</h2>

        <p><strong>Tuesday, 25th September</strong> from <strong>1.45-3.30pm</strong> we will be
        opening our doors for the afternoon. All are welcome to visit our school to see what goes in
        our classrooms. This is especially relevant to any new parents wishing their children to
        start in September 2013.</p>

        <h2>Footballers Of The Week</h2>

        <p>Last week this was awarded to <strong>William Clamp</strong> in <span
        class="yeargroup">Y4</span> and <strong>Alex Cockram</strong> in <span
        class="yeargroup">Y1</span>.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> Trip To Hill Farm</h2>

        <p>Last Thursday <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> visited Hill Farm in Winscombe on a
        team building trip. There were several activities including a one mile
        walk. <strong>Mark</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> said:</p>

        <blockquote><p>“You had to rely on the others in your team for help if you were to succeed
        at the activities”.</p></blockquote>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 4</span> Trip To Hill Farm</h2>

        <p><strong>Connie</strong> and <strong>Sophie</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year
        4</span> said they travelled on the coach to Winscombe Rugby Club and then walked along the
        Strawberry Line and through the dark tunnel. The activities they did included spiders web,
        grass skiing, orienteering and the water tube. They had fun and also met a dog called
        Humbug.</p>

        <h2>Parking</h2>

        <p>Please be considerate when parking around school. Use the back gate for walkers and
        cyclists and the front gate for dropping children off safely!</p>

        <h2>Lost</h2>

        <p>We have lost a little brown bear that used to sit on the chair outside the office. It
        would be lovely if he was to reappear!</p>

        <h2>Coming In And Out</h2>

        <p>If you are taking your child out of school for appointments please make sure you sign
        them in and out. These are the only times the front door of the school should be used by
        children unless the school gates are already closed. EXCEPT our Reception parents while
        their children are part time.</p>

        <h2>Volunteers Needed!</h2>

        <p>A note from our new school gardener:</p>

        <p>Large areas of the school gardens have become overgrown and require urgent
        maintenance. So that we can allow the children to once again fully enjoy a fabulous
        environment a working party has been organised for <strong>Saturday 22nd September</strong>
        from <strong>10.00am-4.00pm</strong>. We would greatly appreciate any support or time you
        are able to give. Refreshments will be provided. Please help us to return our school gardens
        to something we can all be proud of. For more information contact <strong>Claire
        Smith</strong> on <strong>01934 853320</strong> or <strong>07747632015</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Role Model Wrist Bands</h2>

        <p>We are introducing wrist bands for our <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> role models
        to wear in school. So as not to be confusing we would like to ask that all other children do
        NOT wear wrist bands in school. Thank you.</p>
