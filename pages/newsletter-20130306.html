        <p><span class="yeargroup">Year 3</span> enjoyed a wonderful Celtic Day last Thursday,
        dressing up and finding out about how the ancient Celts used to live. They made Celtic
        shields and jewellery and our special visitors helped the children build a roundhouse, make
        string and even grind wheat to make flour. A special thank you to <strong>Mr. &amp;
        Mrs. Hughes</strong>, our Celts, and <strong>Mrs. Hobson</strong> who baked Welsh cakes from
        dawn ‘til dusk.</p>

        come into the office and pick up a booking form and return by <strong>Thursday</strong>
        (sorry for the quick turnaround). A letter was sent home last week for children already
        receiving lessons and the office will assume they wish to continue unless told
        otherwise.</p>
