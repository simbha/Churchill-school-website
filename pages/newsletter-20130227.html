        <h2>Worship</h2>

        <p>We are all wiser this week after our series of worship stories about wisdom. Our theme
        for next week’s worship will be ‘Consideration’. We will be looking at how we respect all
        kinds of people from all kinds of backgrounds.</p>

        <strong>11.00am</strong> at St. John’s churches on <strong>10th March</strong>. On the

        <h2>Dance Your Socks Off</h2>

        <p>Last Wednesday evening <span class="yeargroup">Year 2</span> took to the stage of the
        Playhouse in Weston. They joined a host of children from other local primary schools for a
        magical and unforgettable evening of dance inspired by the Strawberry Line. Our ‘sweeties’
        dazzled and delighted the audience.</p>

        <h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> T@3</h2>

        <p>Thank you to all the parents for their help and support last Friday and to all those who
        attended T@3. We raised about <strong>£160</strong> which will go towards our Steam Museum
        trip in Swindon. We’ll report back after the trip.</p>

        <h2>Netball Tournament</h2>

        <p><span class="yeargroup">Years 5 and 6</span> took part in the netball tournament held at

        6</span> team got through to the semi-fianls! Well done everyone!</p>

        <h2>Calculation Policy/Math Workshop</h2>

        <p>This week you will have received the new Maths Calculation Policy. This was shared with
        the parents who came to the maths workshop on <strong>7th February</strong>. If you would
        like to comment on the policy or have any questions please pop in and see your child’s class
        teacher.</p>

        <p>A booklet ‘Supporting your child at home’ will be distributed at Parent’s evening. This
        gives examples and ideas of mathematical activities you and your child can share at
        home.</p>

        <h2>World Maths Day – 6th March 2013</h2>

        <p>Please encourage your child to register for this event. The website <a
        href="http://www.worldeducationgames.com">www.worldeducationgames.com</a> is sponsored by
        Unicef and encourages children from all over the world to play against each other. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>School Orchestra</h2>

        <p>There are still places in our school orchestra run by <strong>Mr. Gateshill</strong>,
        from North Somerset Music Service, on a Wednesday after school. We have plenty of
        instruments to be tried so you don’t need to own one just be interested in learning. If your
        child is interested please see <strong>Miss Mullins</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year
        3</span>.</p>

        <h2>Website</h2>

        <p><strong>Mr. Hurst</strong>, who currently updates our website on a voluntary basis, will
        be ‘retiring’ when his daughter leaves our school in July. We are searching for another
        parent to help with this important task. Please pop into the office if you are interested in
        this exciting voluntary post.</p>

        <h2>Absences</h2>

        <p>There were a total of 32 holiday absences in January. That means 16 days of children’s
        learning were lost. Please think carefully before you book holidays in term time. </p>

        <h2>Computer Games</h2>

        <p>All of our ICT equipment is protected by a secure ‘firewall’ maintained by South West
        Grid for Learning. At home children have access to a wider range of websites than they can
        access in school. Do you know what websites your children visit?</p>

        <h2>Walk To School</h2>

        <p>Unfortunately we had a poor turn out for our Walk to School Day last week, hopefully this
        was due to the cold weather. We look forward to a better result next time.</p>

        <div id="rednose">
        <h2>Red Nose Day – Friday 15th March</h2>

        clothes</strong> in return for <strong>£1</strong>, this should be given to your class
        teacher on the morning.</p>

        <h2>Ofsted Interventions</h2>

        <p>Since our Ofsted in October we have all be working hard to improve the areas they
        notified as “requiring improvement”. We are still waiting for a visit from Her Majesty’s
        Inspector (HMI) who was due 4-6 weeks after the inspection!</p>

        <p><strong>Mrs. Lloyd</strong> has seen improvements in the planning and teaching of
        maths. We have updated our assessment system so that we ensure pupils are continually making
        progress and if not we are taking action to support their learning. The staff team are
        feeling very positive about our progress and look forward to the HMI visit to validate our
        work.</p>
