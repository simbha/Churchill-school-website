        <h1>Newsletter - 15th September 2010</h1>

<p>The term has got off to a busy start with children settling quickly into their new classes and 
enjoying learning. Lots of information to share with you this week -  the basic dates for the year 
are attached and we will keep you informed via our website and letter as new ones are added.</p>

<h2>PTA</h2>
<p>Heads our list - they work hard to support the school financially and provide many social events 
as well. The PTA AGM will be on Tuesday, 28th September at 7.30pm in the school hall. It 
would be lovely to see parents, come and enjoy a glass of wine while we hear about the PTA's 
successes and future plans.</p>

<h2>Parking & Walking</h2>
<p>Please park away from corners and respect the cones left out for the coaches - most often on a 
Tuesday for swimmers. If you park at the Stag and Hounds and walk through Larch Close 
please respect the residents' gardens and boundaries. Recently residents have commented that 
children (sometimes with parents) are kicking gravel, balancing on paving stones etc.</p>

<h2>Raising Extra Funds</h2>
<p>THE GIVING MACHINE - SHOP ONLINE & RAISE FUNDS FOR OUR SCHOOL  - Don't forget 
you can now generate free cash donations for the school every time you shop online via The 
Giving Machine, registering is easy and it will not cost you anything extra. Go to 
www.TheGivingMachine.co.uk</p>

<h2>Dinners</h2>
<p>CORRECTION! Thank you to the parent who pointed out our error! School dinners are actually 
£1.95 per day, £9.75 per week and £66.30 for the term. Prompt payment would be much 
appreciated.

<p>Football players also got off to an active start Dylan Yandell and Ben Hughes were awarded the 
accolade of "Star Players of the week"</p>.
<p>Well done for being the first of the school year.</p>

<h2>Harvest Lunch</h2>
<p>Still time to sign up for this lovely community event. We will be operating family sitting and 
details will follow. We will be sharing the money raised between Woodford Primary School and 
Weston Hospice. Harvest services are planned, KS1at 9.45am and KS2 at 11.00am.</p>



<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>Thank you for all the reply slips for school clubs, these will be starting week  beginning 27th 
September and information will be out soon. As we have had no interest in Tag Rugby we will 
now be offering Cricket instead - please collect details from the office.</p>

<h2>Service Theme </h2>
<p>Next week we will be thinking about Our Environment.
We are also learning about roles/responsibilities of children this week - "Children have a right to 
education" and a "Responsibility to learn and encourage others to learn".</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>We will be working closely with Churchill Music! again this year. They have organised a 
childrens concert in partnership with St. Mary's Church. The interactive even featuring the 
Galeazzi Flute & Strings will take place on Saturday, 9th October, 10.30am-1.30pm. Tickets 
available at the door.</p>

<h2>Eyes And Teeth</h2>
<p>A message from the school nurse, "The School Nursing Team see children in Reception Class 
to check their vision but do not assess children's vision again. We therefore recommend that 
parents/carers arrange for their children to be assessed by an optician every 2 years (this is free 
for children under 16 or under 19 in full-time education). We also recommend that children visit 
the dentist every 6 months - this is also free for children under 18. 
For health-related enquiries the School Nursing Team can be contacted on 10275 866724.</p>

<h2>Do You Have A Young Child?</h2>
<p>Parents of children born between 1st September 2006 and 31st August 2007 are reminded that 
now is the time to apply for a school place for the 2011-12 school year. You can apply online at 
www.n-somerset.gov.uk/admissions or request a paper application form from North Somerset 
School Admissions and Transport Team on 01275 884078. You must apply, even if you have 
an older child attending the school, as places are not guaranteed for younger brothers and 
sisters. Please ensure you submit your application by the closing time and date of midnight on 
15th January 2011 to be considered in the first round of allocations.</p>
