<h2>Life Bus</h2>
<p>Last week all children spent time on the Life Bus learning about social issues that they may experience during their lifetime. Each class had a different level of input suitable to their age.
Jack Davey in Year 6 said "We learnt bout which drugs are safe to take and about what alcohol can do to your body".</p>

<h2>Year 6 Lifeskills Trip</h2>
<p>Year 6 really enjoyed their trip to Life Skills in Bristol on Thursday, Lucy John commented "At the Life Skills Centre my favourite activity was the fire experience because it had realistic features and for the future if we come across a fire we will know what to do and what it is most safe to do in this situation".</p>

<h2>Year 6 Working Hard</h2>
<p>The Year 6 team have been working with the children to encourage use of descriptive language. Here is a sample of Ben Hughes' coast poem:</p>
<p>Wet pebbles huddle together for warmth only to be denied heat by the cold relentless waves......
......The sand lays sprawled across the beach having taken a hard beating from the pounding surf. Grateful to the graynes for repelling the bullying breakers.</p>

<h2>Youth Speaks Competition</h2>
<p>Last Thursday evening six children from Year 6 entered the Rotary Club Youth Speaks competition where they had to speak in front of a large audience at Shipham Village Hall. There were eleven teams in total from this area and the standard was amazingly high! Our first team (Jess Vernon/Daniel Bugg/Tom Probert) chose to speak about the threats to our marine life globally "There are plenty more fish in the sea......"
Our second team (Ben Hughes/Benedict Pearce/Luke Young) chose to persuade the audience that electric cars are the way of the future and asked the question "Are electric cars taking the lead? It was an enjoyable night for everyone and both teams did extremely well. Well done to you all!</p>
