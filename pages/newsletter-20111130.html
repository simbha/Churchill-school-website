<h2>Life Bus</h2>
<p>Last week all children spent time on the Life Bus learning about social issues that they may experience during their lifetime. Each class had a different level of input suitable to their age.
<strong>Jack Davey</strong> in <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We learnt about which drugs are safe to take and about what alcohol can do to your body".</p></blockquote>

<h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> Lifeskills Trip</h2>
<p><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> really enjoyed their trip to Life Skills in Bristol on Thursday. <strong>Lucy John</strong> commented:</p>

<blockquote><p> "At the Life Skills Centre my favourite activity was the fire experience because it had realistic features and for the future if we come across a fire we will know what to do and what it is most safe to do in this situation".</p></blockquote>

<h2><span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> Working Hard</h2>
<p>The <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> team have been working with the children to encourage use of descriptive language. Here is a sample of <strong>Ben Hughes</strong>' coast poem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wet pebbles huddle together for warmth only to be denied heat by the cold relentless waves......</p>
<p>......The sand lays sprawled across the beach having taken a hard beating from the pounding surf. Grateful to the graynes for repelling the bullying breakers.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Youth Speaks Competition</h2>
<p><strong>Last Thursday</strong> evening six children from <span class="yeargroup">Year 6</span> entered the Rotary Club Youth Speaks competition where they had to speak in front of a large audience at Shipham Village Hall. There were eleven teams in total from this area and the standard was amazingly high!</p>
<p> Our first team (<strong>Jess Vernon</strong>, <strong>Daniel Bugg</strong> and <strong>Tom Probert</strong>) chose to speak about the threats to our marine life globally "There are plenty more fish in the sea......"</p>
<p>Our second team (<strong>Ben Hughes</strong>, <strong>Benedict Pearce</strong> and <strong>Luke Young</strong>) chose to persuade the audience that electric cars are the way of the future and asked the question "Are electric cars taking the lead?</p>
<p> It was an enjoyable night for everyone and both teams did extremely well. Well done to you all!</p>
